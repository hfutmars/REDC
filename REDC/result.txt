i am fully aware that there are some out there who will give me some , even for an intermediate review on a classic album such as this one , but i really do have to ,
honestly , having been forced to hear this a number of times , my best friend and i thought it best to go somewhere where we were sure we we not going to hear it . ,
like with a handful of the i own in my now far larger cd collection , this album has been in my since i was about 14 , so needless to say , i should have ,
honestly , i should have done this review a while ago , but then again , considering the fact that i now have over 800 cds worth of music ( and counting ) , combined with ,
for one thing , i have to give credit for to try some songs without the use of on this album in contrast to animal . that might not be a bad thing , if she

i listen to a lit of classical music and find this collection one of my favorites . . almost all of it is background . this cd is full of favorites which i fall into humming ,
the best part of this song is the different used in the solos by different instruments . even some sax is thrown in . harmonies are excellent . to light and , and their range is ,
i must own ten versions of we have heard on high . compared to them , the king and country version is a different take . i love the places the artists have chosen to go ,
i find peace in this album . the gentle is quite . you probably need to know to get the full experience , but just listening along is quite an experience . i picture this being ,
another in a great collection of music just the thing for sitting in the afternoon setting sun gets the ,
excellent album for and . more familiar tunes than volume one . good quality , but i do n't have high end equipment so i 'd never hear the problems anyway . just good solid music ,
a christmas ! good music . great singer . fun songs . get 's the party up and . can you say lee ? anyway , i really liked the song , so i bought the ,
very good mix of some great artists . different versions of traditional songs , like violins in i saw three ships ( david ) . good of tunes . just right for background . it 's ,
if you like classical , . and , this is the album for you . good quality . 30 tracks of familiar pieces . it does n't make me , rather helps be concentrate , even ,
i learned so much from t 's july 2010 post . i suggest you take a look at that first . an interesting of music . i love most of the music . many bands . ,
try this as background for your next function . no , not that huge everybody you know one , just the intimate ones . you 'll notice a melody , then you 'll start to hum ,
it 's all here ; twang , banjo riffs , guitar , picking solos . classic bluegrass done . even the c w solo which i am not fond of that genre . if you are ,
sampler . quite a tune . good vocal . good band . good quality . i like the band 's style . i bought the album and it 's ever better . ,
good of music , not strictly celtic music , at least it was not what i expected . still a good song . singing and music is excellent . technically excellent good long orchestra piece you ,
sampler . 10 seconds of joy . really like the tempo good vocal . good backup . i 'm in love with brown and have bought all her ,
solo to a classic . has good range . excellent accompaniment . backup comes in at just the right time and is in perfect pitch . instant favorite technically ( recording ) excellent . nothing new ,
very good trio . they 've had so many songs that they blend together . the piano is what makes this song a . i do n't know how you can have a party without this

cherry bomb is my fav john song . i got it for a happy i 'm putting together because it just puts a smile on your face when listening to it . ,
i was impressed by the music on this , as out of songs , i only two , found 13 that i really liked , about 27 that i thought were pretty good and the rest ,
i had never heard of before , but this is a great group ! i really like the music . it 's worth downloading and giving a try especially since it 's free . ,
i 'm more of a rock person and have a small collection of dance electronic but this sampler is great ! the two by were a bit much for me , but i loved cotton 's ,
is very enjoyable . 's voice is wonderful , the song selection is diverse and i ts obvious he 's a very young man with lots of potential . ,
i 'm not much into , but this song is very good . the story line is realistic and not a bunch of folks cops and doing women . so even though i did n't love ,
i love every song in this sampler . they are smooth and mellow , just right for to after a day . perfect background music for dinner or getting cozy on the couch with a special ,
you have to admit , the song 's tune is . sure , they caught their share of about their talent ( or lack of ) , but i always loved the song and their show ,

from the opening notes of ball , this cd is pure . it is an , rocking number with clever lyrics , driving guitar , with just enough fiddle . up thing is about a guy ,
's harmonies on their fourth release . the first single little white church is and fun with its lyrics and hand . life rolls on is probably the second most song on the cd and is ,
people age , it 's a fact of life . instead of trying to maintain a certain sound , nicks is who she is , a nearly year old woman with a lot of tough miles ,
i have been excited for this cd since hit the radio and since hearing some of the songs live this summer . self made should be the band 's , it is about the you when ,
i 've never met , but i feel very connected to him through his music . he co wrote most of the songs and his voice is so smooth , making his a very personal and ,

well it 's been 25 years and finally we have a new album from . in my opinion it is n't quite as good as to death or pros cons but it is still classic . ,
great collection at a great price ... pair this with the two cd best of set that also came out today and you will have the essential . ,
great quality of music ... great quality dvd ... i saw him in at the and will never forget it ... to the person who wrote the one star review about being left off of this ,
some at the song list here ... i am glad they did not repeat a lot of the tunes that were on past 90 's releases . the sound quality is fine and so is the ,
put simply ... is jackson 's best album since running on empty ... the melodies and lyrics are excellent . his voice has a bit of to it but that is to expected . favorite tracks ,
i really expected more from ... especially after waiting over 15 years . expected better beats and better ... perhaps he is out of ideas . ,
not a bad cd ... do n't get me wrong ... i like all types of music but honestly i was hoping for something a little more ... rock country oriented . this cd is just ,
what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off . i understand it was a daunting task to make a of this ... but come on ,
never really went anywhere ... but at points over the last decade i feel she lost her way slightly by trying to hard to create musical concept records . do n't get me wrong ... i ,
all i can say is wow . i was n't sure what to expect when i heard that was n't playing any piano whatsoever on this record but i 'm thrilled to say that this is

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,

the best by one of the best ! why this was not as big a hit as his later work or why he went all the way to 's just the way you are for another ,
yet another in a seemingly endless series of side projects and appearances , etc , etc . this one is outstanding in that it is a sound we do n't often her from and his band ,
listen carefully to the lyrics . they were about the anyone got in the 70 's . they may sound at first but listen carefully . it 's worth having more , but if you are ,
to me this is among 's greatest songs . yet it is left off of most . i had two other so i bought just this track to fill in a gap . but if you ,
to me this is among 's greatest songs . yet it is left off of most . i had two other so i bought just this track to fill in a gap . but if you ,
i first heard these guys on a link to a you tube video . the song was so good i had to check out the album . unlike many others , this group to care and ,
the best by one of the best ! why this was not as big a hit as his later work or why he went all the way to 's just the way you are for another ,
this was left out of the cd i have . it is a must have if you like the . so now i have it . ,
more time has been spent these lyrics than most any others . there has to be some kind of hidden somewhere in there . if you a child of the 70 's you know this song ,
no name choir , probably studio musicians . but they do a good job and the price is unbeatable . however , this does abuse the term must have . ,
with to . this is a great sad song from one of the most popular , most bands of the 70 's . definitely not classic rock , but soft rock as it was called at ,
perhaps one of the greatest soul songs of all time . it also had appeal . it has numerous times thanks to appearances and cover versions . this is the original ! there were a single ,
left off of many this song is one of my favorite songs . it was a fitting description of my who was killed in a car accident at a fairly young age not long ago . ,
's best . one of the great of the touched by an tv series . ,
personal favorite . huge hit in . maybe not so much in the us . but if you were around ago your very likely to recognize it . great song . has been covered by other ,
one of the better versions . it is probably the version you know . ,
the formula is simple ( minus silicone ) plus ( minus the park ) price ! lots of to texas swing , classic country and even a few to 60s pop . some of the songs ,
originally on the minor label release cold spring , this is to my taste at his very finest , maybe the best love song he wrote . unfortunately , had to from the lousy deal and ,
a massive collection at a great price ! but be warned the vox box series of classical was recorded in the 50 's and 60 's and some cuts in the series may date back even ,
listen carefully to the lyrics . they were about the anyone got in the 70 's . they may sound at first but listen carefully . it 's worth having more , but if you are ,
no problems downloading . be cautious there are versions by this artist that are covers made later in his career . i believe this is the original .

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,

there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been ,
when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs ,
there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and ,
when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,

i pre ordered this album and was able to download the in i and the negative one ahead of the full release date . i was beyond impressed with these tracks and was interested to see ,

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i ,
do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the ,
keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line , ,
when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede ) ,
i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her . ,
as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 . ,
sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w . ,
i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's ,
this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format . ,
ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear ,
seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their . ,
i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me ,
yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my ,
great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out ) ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share ,
this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby ,
this s e like meets ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as . ,
although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and ,
head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the ,
it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the ,
more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these ,
the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole ,
i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart . ,
it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this ,
ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all ,
ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is ,
saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e . ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes ,
i have always been as far as liking petty 's music . yeah , i own the greatest hits album and yeah i think it 's pretty good . were there more acts that should 've ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
this song sounds like what the fat black cat that for would sound like if he did a song with the members of . this song is nothing special , sorta like a smooth silky up ,
does n't , the . chorus remind you of the people or sweaty men ? . .

forgot about this song , let alone the artist . was well worth the listen . a little over produced by today 's standards . brought back some memories from my younger days . ,
this is an excellent mix of music . and , you ca n't beat the price . listened to the entire album several times already . ,
the perfect cd to spin when with the guys . lots of . ,

great tunes and very after all these years . ,
just the right type of music for st . 's day . holds up as a of listening or filling in the background to set the mood . on top of that , it was free ,

this is not the brown i fell in love with . much like last cd it seems all too many great bands follow the pop road and change their sound to more people . this cd ,
real country . is amazing ,
is great . she 's like a modern day women . ,
if could sing they would sound like chris . this is a must listen for everyone . ,
this guy is a once and a lifetime talent . ,
can do no wrong . every song he people can to . songs like endless summer and the more dark songs like lessons learned . we have all had these moments in life and describes them ,
this is real country . we need more guys like today

reminds us all that its not beer or material things that matter in life , but good ,
a really good sound to it with some steal drums mixed in ,

definitely surprised to see on the track listing for tangled up ! i just saw an and that he wanted to create a do n't you wanna stay esque duet so one of his suggested , ,
i see lil has n't changed a bit . still in that voice of his . guess what buddy ? it ai n't anymore . is dead . ,
i 'm not sure how this happened but the results are well ... less than satisfying . i like pop music as much as anyone else and i love hip but this sounds forced , like ,
first , he wants women to talk dirty to him . now he wants them to shake their for him . guess what ? women are not objects who exist solely to satisfy your . your ,
fifth harmony has themselves ! this is way than 's work , and this is coming from someone who 's die hard . they do n't need to worry about people getting the two songs mixed ,
poor ... just ca n't catch a break . she thought that flavor of the month would help her return to the top of the charts . little did she know that the majority of the ,
it me to see that has so far from it 's alt rock . i understand that they always select the more pop friendly songs as singles , like the only exception and still into you ,
this song is trying way too hard to be the song of the summer . five is seriously at this point it 's safe to say they 'll do anything for chart success . does n't ,
song , but she 's quite the person is n't she . this is her attempt to address the against her in ed 's do n't ? you wanted my heart but i like just liked ,
look , as a member of the community , i appreciate the message and behind same love . but real talk that was one of the most i 've ever heard . and now vocalist is ,
ok hold up , why is this listed under ? this is j 's song and let 's be real it 's her show . her voice just and she lets the know that she 's ,
wow wow wow . who would 've thought that a piano would become one of 's most songs ? she 's in before ( take a bow , ) , to varying degrees of success , ,
to 's response in regards to ... ! this song is a joke . her career is long over . go away already . ,
great song . just makes every song , no matter how generic , that much better with his wonderful . ,
they 're still at it ? lol . i have n't even heard of the fray since my middle school days nearly 10 years ago , when everyone thought that how to save a life song ,
such a fun song . beats the by far . do n't know what was thinking working with that ( for the time ) in the first place ... ,
why does this fool expect anyone to be loyal to him ? his track record pretty much any right to such claims . seriously though , talk about a double standard ... women who are n't ,
this song is absolutely stunning . 's vocals are gorgeous as usual , and her delivery is so that i could totally picture every line ( her and her boo sitting under a moon , to ,
using a soul legend 's name for your song is at best . i highly doubt 's estate agreed to this ... i mean if they took issue with and 's ( rather ) sample of ,
i have no idea what butter is but this song is ! love the lyrics and how they all seem to be off each other 's energy ! ,
i always knew she did n't one original bone in her body ! this song is a total rip off of ! go listen to it and tell me they do n't have the same melody ,
actually i let her go and i could n't be happier . i 'm really not sure what he is whining about . next ! ,
definitely not what i was expecting from the top two in country music but i absolutely love it ! with this song , they thought , why should we let the boys do all the ? ,
wow wow wow ! i never thought a country song with an electro r b beat and style delivery would work but damn , i am impressed ! looking forward to more music from this former ,
i would buy this for the single cover alone ! i mean just look at them abs ... ... luckily , it 's a great song as well . buy it now ! ,
seriously ? this is what pop music has come to ? little girls with no obvious talent who sing in the shower can now be packaged up and marketed as artists ? ! a break . ,

this song is trying way too hard to be the song of the summer . five is seriously at this point it 's safe to say they 'll do anything for chart success . does n't ,
what 's wrong with being confident ? nothing . what 's wrong with this song though ? everything . this generic , is 's idea of ? and to think , this is supposed to be ,
, how , given that 's voice is anything but powerful ! i really wish she would give it up already . every time she opens her mouth , it just sounds like she 's out ,
this is seriously my jam ! this is definitely on my bucket list now for when i 'm rich . it 's refreshing to hear sing so honestly about ! side note to amazon users please ,
this is one of the most subtle songs on , yet it 's one of the best . such a lush , groove . i could listen to this song on repeat for hours . people ,
cheap is a cheap song that only hit one because her label and or were so for a one hit that they had it to for like six months and added paul to the to give ,
come on , is trash and you ought to be ashamed for with that no talent . she is seriously like the female , only by . if you do n't care , then how do ,
do you ever feel like a plastic bag through the wind wanting to start again ? i 'm sorry what ? i do n't know what she was on when she wrote this song but i ,
yes , wrote this song . but damn if it 's not one of the most , songs i 've heard all year . this one out of the park , and country radio should be ,
let me get this straight he on with and yet somehow it 's all 's fault and country fans are just it up ? the is unbelievable ... no wonder country music is in the sad ,

wish these two would get back together for good . loved them during my teens and still love them . they , in my opinion , will never fail to be committed to every baby memories ,
talk about a sexy , individual who know how to express in song how he really and truly feels . so good at what he does and the i 'm sure affects all who listen just ,
very sexy songs , good mood , and i highly recommend this group to all who need to and get the day off their mind . ,
i actually ca n't remember how i even came across this song . so , all i can say is i liked it enough to purchase it the time i heard it but did n't research ,

i am addicted to this song . i have never heard of this artist until i watched soul session . this is an awesome and beautiful , sexy , song ! ,
awesome ,
i never heard of this artist until i saw her on the gospel show . her voice is so beautiful ... and i love this song ! i am looking into buying more of her music ,
i heard this song on gospel and thought it was nice . however , today i was cleaning out my and listening to gospel music and this song came on and i was almost in tears ,
this reminds me of 's , but a second rate version . it is not terrible , but it was not great . i hope i only paid . 99 for it . ,
is so strong in her lyrics and music . i am a big fan and i try to support her as much as possible . this really is a nice song . ,
i initially heard this song while traveling back from , . i thought it was so hot . however , i was disappointed after hearing it a few times because it does not include enough of ,
love it

most of these 100 selections are great , beautiful and i love them . there are always a few that i because i 'd rather listen to the others . good purchase ! ,
i am so happy with my classical music . most come from the 99 cent and they are a great deal . ,
i knew i would n't be disappointed with this ... and i was n't . these are so lovely and such a value . ,
these are so good to listen to anytime of the day it does n't have to be just for . this is anytime music . ,
i enjoy the music and really liked the album cover ... such a neat idea , eh ? this is a good deal for anyone who likes classical music . ,
's music is soooo good . i enjoy every piece and listen to it while working at the computer or being quiet or anytime . such a great value album . ,
i enjoy most of the selections on this album . some of them are not what i had in mind . i made a of the pieces that suited me . ,
this was one of my earlier . definitely a different sound . do n't listen to it as often as often as traditional classical music ... but it is what i thought it would be . ,
what can i say ... i love this music . the album is a great value for anyone who likes classical music . ,
oh , my ! takes me back many years . do n't really know why i like it so ... it 's just everything about it and each of the voices , and especially ! it ,
music box selections were unusual and not my favorite ; was by the foreign singing , but i enjoyed it even not always knowing what was being said ; so many good , good selections .

why try to change him now ? what was it you wanted ? for long long time fans , this is a down a side road ( another another self ) much like the good as ,
only gets better the more you listen . it is like son of dark side of the moon . sort of like david gilmour recording with u2 produced by someone like steve . ,
decent , laid back release , somewhat over rated ( like james taylor 's new album ) . it does contain one truly superb song ( ) which should be more than it has been .

i really enjoy the movie , especially taylor 's safe and sound song . the is very mysterious and , to say the least . ,
if i die young by the band , is one of those songs that will probably always be around . the song brings memories of warm summer days to me . i really enjoy the vocals ,
who does love this song . . i mean come on , it 's a classic karaoke song . every drunk person in the local bar wants to sing it and it 's always a death ,

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i ,
do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the ,
keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line , ,
when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede ) ,
i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her . ,
as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 . ,
sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w . ,
i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's ,
this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format . ,
ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear ,
seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their . ,
i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me ,
yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my ,
great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out ) ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share ,
this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby ,
this s e like meets ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as . ,
although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and ,
head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the ,
it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the ,
more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these ,
the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole ,
i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart . ,
it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this ,
ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all ,
ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is ,
saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e . ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes ,
i have always been as far as liking petty 's music . yeah , i own the greatest hits album and yeah i think it 's pretty good . were there more acts that should 've ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
this song sounds like what the fat black cat that for would sound like if he did a song with the members of . this song is nothing special , sorta like a smooth silky up ,
does n't , the . chorus remind you of the people or sweaty men ? . .

while i am not a big fan of , this recording sounded over to me and lacked passion . the recording sounded overly compressed for classical music . the were muted sounding . nice to listen ,
compared to the old muted sounding youtube video this file sounds much better . sounds closer to the original studio tape . this is probably one the 's greatest hits . ,
i just had to add this classic rock tune to my growing collection . a huge hit back in the day , it still gets air play even today . this rock made very effective use ,

ill be the first to admit that i do not really listen to this type of music , but this song is so good ! it 's even better than up kicks . ,
forever by ft . , lil wayne , and , is one of hip 's most , and brilliant songs ever produced . 's part is by far the best , following by , then , ,
i have enjoyed all of her previous songs , but this song takes the throne as the best . the addition of the , the melody and video , and the fact that it is for ,
rock that body is one of the best songs from the i love 's parts in this song ( she has a high voice , sounds like a sorta ) . this is to be their ,
this song is decent , but not good enough for my ipod . in my opinion it sounds like any other song on the radio . has a good voice but this song does n't impress ,
this song is great . the first half is really good , but once it gets to the middle ( around two 30 ) , the song is insane . the beats are awesome . i ,
i liked her previous singles but this has to be one of her worst that she 's put out . i hear it constantly on the radio and it 's making me like it even less ,
ever since they played this song during the 2012 , this song has been on repeat . not only is it a great song , i love how it brings me back to the , specifically ,
starting off slow , this song turns into a power house song once the chorus comes . this song is very well written . it 's about her times with her band , her producer , ,

this song is so and i heard it before it became a single , and i was glad to see it would become a single . one of her best songs . ,
this is an average song . i basically like most of it except for the chorus ( dance the night away ... etc ... ) . the beginning is pretty and i like 's parts . ,
as a fan of animal ( well most of it ) , she returns with this amazing single . the lyrics are decent this time around and she still delivers a killer beat . no other ,
boom boom is one of most songs . why so much people hate it , i have no idea . this was my favorite song for a while . it deserved to be one for all ,
my friends are all with this song , so i listened to it and so did i . it starts off slow , then gets to a faster chorus . the chorus is brilliant ! i ,
is on a roll with putting out great songs . this is one of her best , especially after watching the great video ! ,
i was n't a big fan of , but i really like this song . it 's very and most people hate it because it uses auto tone , but i do n't really mind it

i really liked the original version of shake up the by train , too bad the rest of the songs on this album are not like that ! all i can say is this album does ,
hits a new low here ! i guess i seen this one coming after hearing about his 4th , recent negative interviews , , anti stuff , and even negative comments about david gilmour , , ,
this is the album that never should have been made , a huge flop and the once king of the charts can sell no records no more ! ,
the new album is certainly not bad , i like the bell very much ! but this album just does n't come across as a pink floyd final release . i think it should have been ,
best album since dog butterfly , five stars , best since le strange , back to the old classics , etc . give me a break ! had this album been released in the 70 's ,
even with the different instruments and style changing , this band still sounds exactly the same as they did in the beginning ! this is the main reason why this type of alternative music did n't

i like his guitar playing his versatility . but the songs themselves are pretty much there he reminds me of , , etc . . with the acoustic guitar . been there down that better in ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
is still the standard of because who else could make folks wait nearly two decades for said follow up ? now to me the will always be a standard period . and i still feel that ,
this cat has legit talent , however his material is about as as ex . i mean i have seen him on tv singing and playing drums , etc . . however his talent does n't ,
i have always enjoyed the fifth dimension . the re mastering sounds really good there voices sound strong . i heard alot of there cuts when i was a kid always remembered them . ,
de la soul a different era of hip and they were able to blend a of feel and yet be direct within a context and yet offer their own all at once . this album feels ,
i 've heard there stuff and its a cool of the sounding stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things , however they fall into a phrase called time music which works ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
always been a huge fan of the and michael jackson will always be the king of music to me and he left a mark unlike so few before or since . anyway lets get to the ,
its a cool album where some of the tracks he got some real and then its hit and miss . dig his flow and vibe and it works . in places and a cool set . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
i got this album when it first came out because i say you do . young love this album though on a whole had some moments interestingly has a more grown up vibe that alot of ,
you feel her soul and power on these . this is the real . hearing her doing gospel music is to the soul ears . a must have . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
broke r . still doing a broke take and no musical . now the cat can sing and has moments where his voice saves otherwise paint by the numbers material which leaves alot to be desired ,
kid rock is a frustrating act because just solely on the music front , he covers a few styles , problem is on an album like this he forgot the songs and settles for of what ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
straight up this cat has always had a nice voice and i his longevity from the to film , tv , etc . . cat has kept a brand going , however musically he has always ,
is a very artist to me . her voice is still something else it 's hard to believe she has been around as long as she has is only in her 40 's . she is ,
i guess if you use the formula and solo then throw a bone to and and have a 90 's vibe going on then it will make you appear as something more than the surface . ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
for as as she is and the fact she has a good sound and appeal her solo material tends to leave me rather cold . and while no doubt had good cuts and i feel they ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
its a standard album and at this point and time in her career she has stayed on course with a and its worked with where she is going and wanting to do . now her approach ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
some of these tracks feel like they been sitting in a and while he has some moments , he does n't have that modern day money track that r . always brings to him . sounds ,
this was a good soulful and feel good project . i have much respect to because she was only getting better with time and she was n't as the industry is so age struck , she ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
one of those songs which is and easy and it feels good to the ears and it still moves the feet . the harmony and the groove is on point . very soulful and a strong ,
is arguably one of the most over hyped acts over the past decade easily . when she first arrived in her post pop era she seemed like something different . you know was a but in ,
the beach boys say summer with their music and also a time period and time . this collection takes you back to a different time and a this music is truly feel good and laid back ,
this cut still goes hard and i loved the harmony and vibe of this jam . very nine 's and yet direct and its a cool song to have a crisp fall day . ,
one of those artists that had the goods , however he never got the goods . like that pro who was top tier talent , however said person either never had the right , system or ,
rare earth were a good group . i just want to is a tight jam . their take on the get ready is cool . interestingly is their take on the j five 's hum along ,
on the for real , for real it seems like musically got musically after the late 80 's and lost what once made him a force back in the day . this song is boring and ,
is one of those where i keep expecting her to go full james and expect a classic song or , etc . instead of getting her doing 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from lightweight ,
is one of the best technical sounding and he always kept a groove and of course i the old triangle base he came out of with . problem is he is a third tier version of ,
somewhere between being a broke meets a broke and a couple of other acts in places . eye candy factor she is on point , as a music artist she is almost below zero . her ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
john is a musician and overall artist , however this album feels like he went about making an album that takes away from his best strengths as a artist and feels like he settled for a ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
is still as sharp as all get up , however doing a duet with a broke in the album way down and the same goes when is singing with a broke r . in . needs ,
jackson get right all thru here . the words music have genius all over them . i have never heard a bad recording with these two great on it . very straight up at you . ,
he has some trip out jams just like the you gonna trip out on it from start to finish . i have had some of his hits for a few years if you can get into ,
really good balance of the past and present on this album . i 'm glad to see in his solo career and what an act two his solo career has been ? good combination and how ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
paul always keeps his own vibe and groove going and he is truly one of the best ever and the man stays in his and makes music stay steady with his presentation . this album finds ,
stone is one of the greatest musical ever and the bridges and path his sound and style set are still many decades and later and always will to me . and the family stone are one ,
is clearly one of the artists going today . as a songwriter , singer and musician not to mention as a live act he got his thing together . he came back with an album which ,
i like the concept but sounds just like anyone else be it or . alot of the material you can feel in the blank of where you heard it before . she still has time to ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
i have always and lady t . . no to , , etc . . however we did n't to leave these to have true blue eyed soul that stayed true to the root . never ,
this is one of george 's greatest . his playing vocals are incredible . this still shine . a must have . ,
first and foremost i always when black artists take back country music because country music is the baby of r b and gospel music . ray , and have showed you it can be done and ,
is to me . this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day . makes me think of 's closer meets 's white . is trying to channel so much , but ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
it was hit and miss in places . the best duet was with wonder and it worked . the rest are met with mixed results at best . good and production . the duet with john ,
the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she ,
they missed the boat by not having the better songs on the disc . the better cuts are all on the mp3 having said that the songs work better for the show as to their own ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
to me the hardest part of the entertainment industry is and having and making it all connect on the stage and with the pace of the music and this does that and more , its a ,
i have heard this album and i do n't get all the hype . is creative to a extent , but she sounds like trying to channel hill and it has a mixed reaction . the ,
i respect 's skills and the fact he is and , but musically when it comes to what he puts out on himself , there is alot to desired . the tracks feel like they are ,
nobody and i mean nobody is touching this soul brother when he can go from style to style and not miss a beat . i mean to radio message which echos part 's your love is ,
the brothers always seem to get right on the smooth jams . you know they are funky as all heck but they have made some of the most important ballads ever . this incredible family act ,
while knows what his sign is the month he was in , musically he is truly suffering from loss . somewhere between the early 80 's till early 90 's is where is in . while ,
michael jackson has always been period . from his days as a kid leading the to his incredible adult solo run . his vocal instrument alone has touched so many lives . his instrument of a ,
dig the police reggae influence and is the truth musically . he truly is versatile and multi and is going to be a force to be with for many years to come . and this song ,
a great on one of pop music 's most important artists ever . this is the first ever overall of his works as a solo artist and it does him musical justice . for the casual ,
the were the truth and nothing but the truth these songs still hold up really well and the and there versatility leads to that and more . in alot of ways you could n't put them ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
his music is incredible . i have listened to alot of his material . this set is a must have . his timing space is used really well here . leaves i wish i knew really ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
i 've never been that big on jewel sure did n't think she would ever try anything different so i was surprised when i heard her lead single off this set . she is still the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
sweet more than anybody else i have ever heard on a record or radio . his best jams to me were mainly on his set make it last forever . the thing is the cat had ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
this is a pretty good . i feels good , stroke with a cool to of power the family stone . the blues is tight . it never rain in southern california is a classic slow ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
love has a top notch voice and one of those vocalist with the right material could and should have been bigger . this album of material does n't add anything and it does n't capture her ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
its a cool record and right now mark is on the pulse of the music ear and him and alone got the song of the year . i mean funk alone is the jam jam right ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
he got over at a good time as a modern day broke meets a modern day broke michael jackson and it worked for a few projects and he made more of a name for himself as ,
at first i was checking to see what they might go as they have been pretty cool with their folk brand of pop music . however this album feels are for radio play . like they ,
now the dream got a ok pen game for others , however on his own , he just ai n't got alot going for him . as is the case with his previous other r . ,
rock funk all through this disc . the jams grooves never let up . the music non stop . the genius of is on full display here . more bounce to the ounce still makes heads ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,
i was curious about them after hearing there first couple of records and i did n't know they into jimmy ? i 'm hearing this album and it has polished production and some slick however the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,
the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she

i like this song , have n't paid that much attention to the lyrics yet to find out what the meaning is ... video ... the video tells a story . ,
if you like 's music , than you will like this song too ... another good one to add to your mix tape . ,
nothing to be taken seriously about this song , it 's just for fun , and people should n't read too much into it . listen to it on your way home from work , and ,
the song is lovely ! after watching the music video for this song , it really sets a story in your mind . as you 're listening to the song you have the urge to hit ,
liking this song a lot , fun , good to dance to , thinking of seeing her concert in november with my child . ,
i like this song , it 's got some nice lyrics to it . i thought it would of been more popular than it ended up being ... weird . ,
this is the song that made me finally notice last . sure i had heard his songs on the radio before , but i guess i just never paid much attention until this came out .

if you do n't like this album then you basically do n't appreciate the skills . forget the album cover and how it looks . only a few songs and to be able to pull of ,
v 's till is really good ! i thought that the last album was ok however this one has more flavor ! he will never top the first album but to continue to produce strong will ,
i really hate it for because no matter how good it gets the competition keeps changing the game . this album in my opinion is a classic just like the last album . i do believe ,

never understood the that john has for a set of rock tunes played by a killer band . , perhaps , felt that this did n't quite live up to what he wanted it to be ,
no longer obscure or in 's , brightly on their first entirely self produced album . had clearly taken control of the band or co eight of the nine songs . this does n't diminish his ,
contrary to another review here , this is n't the soft machine nor is it live . this album of semi professional recordings of , when they added multi instrumentalist , and vocalist ( original vocalist ,

classic album . if you love it then you 'll definitely want to pick it up if you have capability excellent sound . i do n't love everything on the album , it 's ok if ,
the sound is spectacular , albeit stereo only , if you like this release you will hate yourself for not picking it up . the songs are a mixed bag , touch of but not , ,
give me a break , i like one of the best ever songwriter 's , but he 's not the singer he wants to be . he 's not ... he can put out stuff like ,
van fan ... i was really looking forward to this . the dvd is stereo only . the video is fair ish like tv quality , then . sound ok but stereo only ... so no

this cd is an into a world and have created in white of winter . this is creative , unique music on beatles and deep . considering i bought this cd and listened to it on ,
i think the biggest improvement j . has made during her last two is she has remained . you can now listen to her latest cds without over tracks that the flow . aside from what ,
i absolutely luv this album . in my is damn near the best female r n vocalist around in this era . my fave are hey sexy , and i wonder . the production on this ,
i 'm surprised how many good songs are on this cd . i like every song on here except go round . i also wish they would have included the 12 inch version of something just ,
i was out christmas shopping today and the store i was in was playing this cd in the background . when i went to purchase my item i heard the store talking with a standing behind ,
considering she down this cd from 40 tracks to 13 , it makes me wonder what those other songs sound like . and why put on and i 'm telling you which was already released ? ,
who would have ever thought michael jackson would die in this era ? it does n't seem real , he was n't supposed two die . this collection of hits is almost as good as buying ,
this is not 's best and not his worst either . with the added cd , it gives the extra it needs to be a classic . with three cds to choose from , each cd

i really enjoyed this song , one of the three best songs on the album slippery when wet . ,
good songs by a great singer , but a couple were only so so . really does have a great voice and it shows nicely in this collection of songs . i hope that he continues ,

this is an excellent recording for just pleasant listening , very well done . there is really nothing more to say , as far as i am concerned . ,
it seems to say i did n't care for this cd as much as others of the same type that i have purchased . the price is certainly right , but the sound quality left much ,

with the cover i was expecting the music to be faster . a lot of it was good music but with a on the front i was expecting faster beats or a more up tempo mix ,
listen to this song , i almost over looked it because it looked depressing , but it is a great workout song . ,
the music and vocals blend into a sound that you to listen to more of their . a sure winner for any library . ,
it picks up quickly and has an easy to listen to quality that makes the singers voice only sound better . ,
a little but a good song once it gets going , background could do with a little less noise , and a little more music . ,
he must have been in a when he wrote this , it needs more music , a better singer , and a point . ,
this song will move you to want to sing even if your not . she has a voice that makes you want to sing along . ,
the lead singer has a nice voice and the music nice while the words could have a little more content to them . it seems like a mix of pop and , so it 's fun ,
a cool song with a quick tempo , not a real dance song but you want to dance along with it . you really may like this song , it 's a little same threw out ,
this song is cool like ice and slower but with a beat that grabs you and makes you want to hear more . ,
the album is both fun and interesting and left me wanting to listen to it with out regret . i would suggest it to any one . ,
i was not sure if i liked it at first but soon found that it was maybe not my usual choice but a good one for me . ,
this artist was all too easy to listen to considering that she chose to go a little different from what i have heard before , i like it . ,
this mix of slow music is awesome for bed time or , it has a very diverse sound to it too that i like very much . ,
this song is great , fun melody , nice clean lyrics , and a fun style to it that pulls you in even if your not usually into blues . ,
the song is and easy to listen to but the words make you if there is a kid in the room , or a person . too bad , they could have had a hit with ,
i am not usually drawn to this kind of music but was happy with this album , some of the songs are a little or repeat things but for the most part , not a bad ,

i found this song to be up beat and from beginning to end . i would suggest it to any one , i would be surprised if this song does not show up more on the ,
if you like the black keys you will love this . i love the sound this band has created for themselves . this band is going to the top . you gotta try it . ,
this song has a cool personality that you will like even if your not really into modern music , the back ground music is cool and her voice is very . ,
while this album is a slower album it has a lot to offer and songs that have a melody and words with meaning that give the a reason to listen . ,
i was very disappointed with this artist , he has a great idea for a song and it up with the f word and acts like it adds some thing , when it does not . ,
this song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song . ,
i have some of there songs other then this and i like all of them , they have a fun beat and a cool back beat . ,
i was expecting a modern sound from the picture , but is coffee house jazz , with a sound so be warned . you might like it , i do , but it is jazz . ,
if you have ever listened to a song and tried to decide , do i like this or not ? this is one of those , i would not say that i do n't like it ,
i usually go for faster music but this mp3 album has a nice kind of mix and flavor you will enjoy . ,
i look for a little more umph in my music then this album has , if you like slow you will like this . ,
this song remind me of a lot of off the beaten path songs , wants to be one of a kind , and is . a mix of pop and coffee house music . ,
bravo , , this song does not fail to please , nice voice and feeling to every word . well done , a must have . ,
a good slow mood song , the sound of her voice is sweet and and even with the slow pace it makes you want to along . she has talent . ,
it reminds me of a slower heavy metal song by a hair band , and quickly becomes acid metal . then switches back . ,
the song is and easy to listen to but the words make you if there is a kid in the room , or a person . too bad , they could have had a hit with ,
the music is well picked but some of it sounds a little slow when put with other songs . it is a nice mix non the less and i am enjoying it very much . ,
i am not sure what the artist was doing here but wow . a little too odd for me . i am not sure what to say except that i did not like it . ,
this song has a very reggae pop feel to it , it has a fun sound and an interesting feel to it . reminds me of an 's song in some ways , very . ,
a good workout song , reminds me of a lot of workout songs with no words , keeps the beat fast and going . ,
this is such a fun song , you find yourself in your seat and wanting to jump up and dance around . and you will . ,
a lot of the same words and the music goes in circles , they could have done more with it to make it a lot better , i am not sure what , but having less ,
this song has a good feel to it even if the lead singer sounds a little , i could see this song going main the second some one finds it . ,
i was expecting to have at least a couple of fast songs , while some of it is much like bob 's slower works , it is a slow jam mp3 for sure . ,
good work out song and neat song on every level . i would recommend it to any one looking for a fun song . ,
it has a nice quality to it , but it is a little slow and drawn out , but it has a nice sound and is well put together to keep you listening without too much ,
this song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song . ,
i have listened to this a couple of times , it 's not too slow but not really fast either . could grow on a person , depends on what you are looking for . i ,
a fun song with a beat that is easy to listen to at any time and easy to add to a play list ,
it has a good message and melody , a little for any one not looking for that , but a fun song . ,
all i can say is what ? she has a great voice what was up with the music sounding like it is in the background , it takes a good song and makes it annoying . ,
i was not into it , you might be , but i was not . not in my library any more . i like some thing a little different then this . ,
it remind me of pop , meets , rock , meets new age , meets all in it 's own . a nice song for the buck ,
sounds like the background music for a horror film or a james film . i found it wanting on many levels . too bad , they could have so much more with it .

on my way to the sun is john 's follow up to of mind released back in 2009 carrying the name also from back in his earlier days . as one reviewer already noted this was ,
if you 're familiar with mystery then you 're already aware that is gonna be a great album . the third one with david at the of lead vocals this album once again delivers . everything ,
first off , i 'm not an iron fan so maybe i can be an to this album as so many others have really this so called solo effort by steve . from reading the reviews ,
i stumbled upon 10 years and the effect when they released it and enjoyed their take on the music industry . for their follow up , another good solid effort here from the band . although ,
to be honest , not a big fan . back in his hey day i really did get sick and tired of hearing 's girl ten thousand times on the radio so that might have made ,
call this ii if you will , well , maybe not , but because it 's another lead singer and doing another album i figured that 's a good title . well , the has already ,
comes back with their album with lead singer much to the liking of fans . i think behind the the between and continues with fans . some fans will love this album while others will just

i love it , but i 'm sure in like a week or two , i 'll fall in love with another song or something . anyways ... yea , ,
there is not a single song on this album where did not help write . it seems like really into her life to reveal her true colors , at least some of them . while yes ,
i would have given this song five stars but the chorus lacked depth as well as the lyrics which i do n't really understand , but whatever honestly it 's an awesome song . ,
i think i mostly bought this song because i heard lady 's applause , and it really lowered my expectations for . however , 's song was better than applause . she 's talking about in ,
i love it , but i 'm sure in like a week or two , i 'll fall in love with another song or something . anyways ... yea , ,
, lovely , i love listening to it , eventually i 'll it and get annoyed with it till then it 's awesome . ,
it 's good , but like um , it just is missing a few things , i 'm not sure . it felt like a up of rock with you by michael jackson and another one ,
seriously what are you doing thinking about purchasing , downloading this song . they play it every three seconds on the radio . if you really like this song and listen to the radio , do ,
it 's good , but like um , it just is missing a few things , i 'm not sure . it felt like a up of rock with you by michael jackson and another one

i really am shocked by all the good reviews . this really is a one two star album at most . definately no fear . songs , lite pop production . just not very interesting at ,
vocals , guitars and a decent edge make a alternative rock album by the . , the lyrics are standard christian rock , but let 's face it , it a pretty popular among today 's

for what it 's worth sounds great and the r b arrangement is n't bad . i 'm just tired of the same songs being recorded over and over with nothing new being done to justify ,
what kind of music is this ? this song is intriguing during its middle inspired sections , but not so much during the rest . if you listen to the whole cd you will find a ,
smith has a great voice for easy listening songs ! i found this song to be more suited to background mood music than to personal listening as the sound does n't change much during the song ,
i 'm not saying it 's the same sound , but it is very similar to the pop country music that taylor is putting out , but with a . it 's very easy to listen ,
version of this standard christmas song has a violin and a . that 's all that you will find different here than almost every other version of this song . i know fans will want this

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,
there is something that i adore about , after she left the . she had honestly grown her voice , but also showed some really great songs over a career that still . she has definitely ,
there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,
there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions ,
there is honestly so much that i can say about the lack of in music today . there are some songs worth their effort , while there are others that could be better overall for their ,
there is no doubt about the lack of traditional r b soul that has been overlooked from radio the past few years . it has not only been sad , it shows that the music industry ,
there is no doubt that this past year has been a much harder year for artists to really deliver quality songs . for yo though , he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
when it has came down to , she has had a lot of good songs , yet so many people have n't given her the real and respect that have her voice well . while so ,
there honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential , but others who just have n't made any good songs all . for , whom last year was really a bit as the i a girl ,
when it has came down to the of john , he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time . what he had done with 's lyrics , he has ,
there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her ,
when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul , ,
there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is ,
if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but ,
there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs ,
when it has came down to , she has shown a really good voice and with her songs , but not all of them have been really . her song from her first album it kills ,
honestly , it is very tough whenever someone young and , dies at a young age , and in a stage in their life . sadly , it has been 20 years since the of michael ,
it is so and sad to know that it has nearly been 35 years since the world lost an amazing and artist . john showed so much success on his own , and when he a ,
when it has come down to recently , there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like lucky for jason . but for , his recent have been a bit weak heart ,
honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the ,
it is just so sad that it would 've been 's birthday . honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years , in ,
when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her ,
when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song ,
when it has came down to , musically she has n't really had the best in her songs that have driven home to her music . sadly , the lack of heart in her basic record ,
when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a ,
when it has honestly came down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant . sadly ,
when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart , and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer . unfortunately , happens to be ,
when it has came down t ballads from the 90 's , there were very few and far between that really had the brilliance , beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into . ,
when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with ,
for , she has shown a lot of strength in her acting in her shown on with and her as a part of . but for her singing , she definitely does n't seem to show ,
there is a real difference between being a singer and a , and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die , and you 're severely . has became the ,
it has felt like ages since has released anything new . the past several years , he had , and was dropped from his label after a set of songs . so it has been awhile ,
it has been a very long time since came out with a good song that . she had done well with tell me when she was a part of theory , and had a few songs ,
when it has came down to what , she has been more of a product , than a real singer . the surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date , ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
it is absolutely so sad that has been a poor role model in her music , and her own status as a , by not only making very poor choices with her own music , but ,
it is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs . has made some of the most songs that have came out the ,
when it has came down to in her songs , she just really does n't deliver anymore in regards to voice , and soul in regards to her songs each and every time . sadly , ,
there is no words to describe the news of today that had passed away at age 57 . with a set of in r b we 've lost this year with , white of earth , ,
when it has came down to girl groups , there are n't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within . musically , it has been much ,
there are sometimes moments where a can be a strong moment for the world , or a song that has lost all of the in the world . that unfortunately is the case with the of ,
it has been nearly 15 years since recorded their classic duet the boy is mine . yet , they are both dealing with a lot of lately , and that is the death of . yet ,
there is no question that when it has came down to real artists , john has made the most dynamic and contemporary songs of the past 45 years in music . that has not only been ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to in music , she has had some songs that have been good , while others have not been able to shine in music before like she and underneath your . ,
when it has came down to right now , there are very few pleasure songs that i love listening to from the 80 's . but honestly , one of the very few songs that surprised ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young and away , that we really have felt like we have enjoyed their music beyond a lifetime and the heart has shown it . white has ,
when it has came down to the past 25 years , has simply been the most dance of all time . her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . but , unfortunately her music ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since george michael and of made it big beyond their dreams and became household names in america . musically , has ended his music career , while ,
when it has came down to , she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing , but drive in good songs either ,
with a lack of really good music coming out the past year , there still have been some surprises that 've came out this year from acts that really been getting to the . for , ,
today would have been 's birthday . she sadly passed away three one two years ago , but the heart and soul of her beautiful and voice had never lost its , while she did lose ,
when it has came down to lo , he has had some ups and as a singer . on his own or with , he just has n't been able to hit more of a . ,
when it has came down to , she has n't been fully able to deliver with striking distance with her music . while she has been very close a few times with her music , not ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had the songs to show that she can sing , yet enough know how to . the songs that she had out there , feel ,
when it has came down to robin , this past year has been a real year with his music , and the smash success of lines . but his ballads have missed the mark with though ,
it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone who is that they have constantly thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those up singers who has been more like a in her ,
it has been a very long time since came out with something new . through it all , she has been through a lot of , with her ex husband on her , and trying to ,
things personally have n't been going 's way , musically and . with the not so surprising breakup of her and , many people have wondered if could bounce back from this . while she has ,
it is so sad to know that it has been 10 years since , the lead vocalist of the lost his battle with cancer at 53 years old . while so many people have honestly turned ,
there are very few and far between male singers that today are really hitting the nail on the head with beautiful music . for sam smith , whom has been new to making music for the ,
if there is honestly one thing i adore about sam smith it is simply this , he can absolutely sing . his songs that he wrote for in the hour have been good , really good ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about a , it goes beyond what can be said . many of today 's female do not come from the heart , and they do not ,
there is no question that there is a of good music that was released in the past several years . but there really have been some surprises that were sure to knock you off your feet ,
it has been a rough past few years for . musically , she has had more hits outside of her own album , anti this past year . her work on songs like and this is ,
when it has came down to , and the hype around her music , it has been more of a than a strength in her voice . she has became so much of a product , ,
there honestly has been question about , and her album circus . while she has n't been able to score that wide appeal with all the problems she had gone through . while she has had ,
it has been a very , very long time since we 've heard anything new from keys . she has had a lot of good songs , but radio started to ignore her from her last ,
when it has came down to green day , musically they have a lot to prove in their songs since american idiot and century . sadly , i have n't heard it in the songs from ,
, when i hear , i have gotten to grow and into the rhythm of her songs , because of how rolling in the deep really hit the nail on the head . but some of ,
when it has came down to pink , she has brought out a into her edge of striking songs like the way she showed it with stupid girls back in , and get the party started ,
there are honestly times were a duet feels like it is a waste on the ears , heart and soul . that sadly has been the case with . her recent for ride have felt more ,
there is honestly no question that there sincerely has been a huge lag of female artists that could 've had more of the talent , if they actually delivered with better choices in song . that ,
there are very few artists that really did break out in the 2000 decade , whose music has meant to so many people , and is also it really means a lot more than just a ,
when it has came down to ed , he had made some of the best songs of the past several years when he came out with his plus album . songs like the a team and ,

it is sad whenever someone young and does not even come close to delivering at the soul of the voice , and instead falling by the . for , she has been trying to into hood ,
there is no doubt that there are some artists who 've made some songs that have felt like flavor of the moment , and those who 've made songs that are just . that sadly is ,
it is honestly a moment , whenever somebody dies with a broken heart . when i had heard about the death of o , whom had the throughout the 90 's , i was shocked . ,
i could not believe the news of hearing that has died . i am deeply beyond what words can even express . her voice is always going to be a and beautiful gem . but when ,
when it comes to really good r b , there are very few that 've shown that heart like keys . after the success of her , songs in a minor , unplugged and of keys ,
when it has honestly came down to artists sampling other singers , there has to be a very classy and distinctive style to follow in suite . for anyone whom samples a john song , they ,
when it has came down to , and the music she has put out , she just does n't into what she had brought out when she ha started with i a girl a few years ,
when it has came down to west , his music has honestly been more mixed than anything that really than anything that really strikes the word genius . sadly , the songs do not when it ,
if there honestly is shown about female singers of today like , and is that they have sincerely stopped coming from the heart . their songs have honestly made them feel more wasted than strong in ,
when it has came down to , musically she has lost her way in her music . after the performance at good morning america this week , many people are starting to wonder whether she really ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
when it has came down to , musically she has not been able to hit the nail on the head with voice and heart . her last album ca n't be tamed was absolutely awful . ,
when it has came down to what has been doing in music , it has been trying so hard to strip away from her image . she failed to it with her ca n't be tamed ,
it is so sad that someone like has been very poor and weak in regards to her songs that she has covered . honestly , throughout 's career , she really has been very poor at ,
it is absolutely so sad that a love that was had faded away . unfortunately , for , she has been hit with so much in her personal life from two n her beloved heart . ,
there is no question that when it has came down to the , they 've made some extremely funny music videos over the years . but if there is one thing that they are not as ,
there honestly is no question about the lack of really good . for whom had scored with i a girl a year ago from her record , one of the boys , her latest single does ,
it honestly is absolutely sad that whenever someone young and has all the talent in the world , can sincerely throw their career away . unfortunately , is one of those singers , who has became ,
when it has came down to pop music right now , it has definitely gone to be pretty lately for so many younger female acts . with songs from , and now with ha , there ,
when it has came down to what the family has tried to do with music , none of them have delivered as strongly as did with in songs and heart . for to follow what did ,
there is no question that there is a lack of really striking music out there . with , she has n't really grown into her music , and brought out a real feeling of strength where ,
there is no question that when it has came down to over the last decade , they have been the most distinctive group when it has came down to music . but they have n't yet ,
there is no question about , and the she had to personally to as a single mom , and with the appeal of being as a artist . but , when it had came down to ,
i am not a huge fan of heavy metal , but honestly it is very surprising to take a spin of great covers . when i heard about , i was not really a huge fan ,
there is no question that chris brown has been through a lot in the . after being labeled as a girl beater from his with for a long while , he has really went through his ,
when it has really came down to jason , he actually has been making some songs that have absolutely delivered , not just in great melody , but keeps up showing why the best songs have ,
when it has came down to , she has honestly the most artist of the past decade . for female artists , it has mainly been about her and everyone else , can go to the ,
when it comes down to great young role models , there are few and far between like from . sadly , though even though she does make a good example for young women , she can ,
there is no question about my heart on the world losing . i have never felt so hurt in all of my life , but i am so glad that everyone is of how important and ,
for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time , ,
when it has came down to michael , he has made some really good songs that have been worth their while . not only that , but unlike so many other artists of today , he ,
there always has been something that has been said about michael jackson , past and present . musically , he had shown a lot of brilliance . but personally , michael was suffering internally and that ,
it has been awhile since has came out with a good song . her last album of an was an absolute and her last song was a absolutely song . her last time she had made ,
when it has came down to lady and her talent , she actually did n't deliver in regards to the music from her record . instead , the songs have been a big of that have ,
there is honestly a difference between a , and a singer who has really been to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore , because they are severely and . unfortunately , is ,
there honestly can be so much said about the music of the 80 's . there are some songs that are really beyond the soul of the heart , and others that may make you think ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
it has been a very long time since came out with new music . but nevertheless , he wanted his work in his songs to be his way , and not the way of what the ,
there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart ,
there is no question that today there has been a huge of good songs on the radio . more artists have chosen to do poor samples from distinctive songs , instead of just covering them . ,
when it has came down to new artists , they have to have the right notes and the right rhythm to make a song deliver . but when it does come down to make up and ,
when it has came down to , he has been one of the most distinctive that had ever came out in the 70 's . with he showed he was a amazing drummer , and stepped ,
when it has came to , she has had her own sound , her own class and a real and respect for soul r b music that back t the days of james brown , as ,
there is honestly a lot that i do love about sam smith . one thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul . ,
there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in ,
it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one ,
when it has came down to keys , ultimately she has been the best artist that has came out the past decade of music . she has had the and especially the style to match in ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has honestly came down to music lately , there have been a lot more artists than good ones , and good songs from great artists . but , there is always something waiting in ,
this past year so far , we 've have lost a lot of that really did know the strength of making great music with the of david and . but also , we 've seen a ,
when it has came down to , her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile . it has been a very long while since she came out with new songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and , really has thrown their own career away . for , she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real ,
hard to believe it has been two years since the world has lost an iconic legend , . but nevertheless , her voice will always past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson had delivered in music for the good and for the bad , he left a remarkable legacy in music that will never be , just like his ,
when it has came down to , she does n't even seem to with pop music . now , she is wasted her voice and ruined her heart in her songs . ball from her album ,
it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very ,
it is so sad whenever we have a artist become so , that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside . the truth about is that she is a product ,
there is no doubt about , as he has been one of the most universal and down to earth singer for the past four decades on his own and with the . but for his latest ,
, when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being ,
it has really became clear to me that has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade . not only for her own work , but she sadly has had some ,
honestly , the past few years for robin have been very hard for him and his personal life , with the end of his to , and losing big in regards to a with his song ,
when it does come down to john legend , he has been mostly known as the next , because of his ballads like heaven knows and his single ordinary people . but , he has n't ,
there is no question that michael jackson was a one of a kind . while he was popular , he died with a very broken heart , and with nothing to show for it , with ,
it is absolutely so sad that has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record , and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a whom has been ,
when it has came down to music this past year , there have really really been very few artists that have made the mark nicely in voice and heart with their songs , than cheap surprises ,
there is no doubt that it has been nearly a decade since jason broke through musically with his single , the . yet , he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the ,
there is so much that can be said about the legacy of john , and his songs from top to bottom . yet , it is so sad that it has been 35 years since john ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since keys came out of the music industry , and has shown that her work , her voice and her style have been both ,
there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's ,
there has been no doubt that there has been a lack from the talent from american this past year , not just on the show but with those who 've been past and . for , ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and leaves this earth so soon , and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music . that has ,
there is so much that i can say about female singer of today , they sincerely do not even come from the heart . with artists like , and others have sincerely sounded more like than ,
it has been a that has n't really brought out her a game into her songs recently . with following up to all i ever wanted , has had a strong gamble to make it worth ,
when it has came down to these days , it has been more about her personal life , than the of the music she wants to sing . it is very sad that she has not ,
when it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices . , whom back up for chris brown on his michael jackson hit she ai n't you , has a lot ,
when it has came down what had shown in music , she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry . but sadly , she has been ,
there is no question that has n't been in the best of shapes musically . while people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new for american this year ,
it is absolutely awful whenever someone has became more of a product than a strong singer . pulling a surprise record to the music industry , well has had a lot of wasted songs that has ,
hard to believe today it is five years since michael jackson lost his own life the way he did . i definitely do not think michael jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a ,
there is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days . but there are those few that have been one hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that . ,
when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england , ,
when it has came down to , she has n't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted . that appeal is written all in her album . ,
there is no question that has been so , that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has away . her music has been more like a fashion of time , but ,
there is no question that today 's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart , and lost its . for acts like jason , he has had a hard time ,
when it has came down to train , they definitely have made some excellent songs over the past several years , that have continued to shine with train 's musical status , of making the kind ,
when a new artist comes out with a song , she has to really drive into her first song . for who back on chris brown 's big hit she ai n't you , which worked ,
when it has came down to , he has had some great songs over the years , on his own and as a part f the brothers . but it has been awhile since mr . ,
last year has been a big year for . with her with the stars , and being a new addition for the sing off for , she has had a bit of . musically , she ,
there is so much that can be said for in her personal life right now . the end of her relationship with her future had ended with him on her , and also her music has ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson in his lifetime , he showed a great deal of good songs , but some of the times , he had songs he had recorded , have ,
when it has came down to movie songs for , lately they honestly just have not been able to in the way they used to back years ago , and all the way through to the ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more , than really soulful on radio . unfortunately , has been one of those that does deserve more credit because of her soul ,
when it has came down to pink , she has n't really hit that nail on the head with the songs yet . after her recent breakup from her , that still has n't yet stopped ,
the past several years have been very rough for . she had a gripe with her label , and said to sony . overall , she took a step further within her voice , and tried ,
it has nearly been a decade since we 've heard anything from . musically , they have been from the scene for a long time , while did well on his brief on american . but ,
it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and striking from . she had been from making music for quite a long time , not just on her own , but ,
when it has came down to movie songs lately , they have seemed to run out of the magic . unfortunately , i believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real , human and voice , and someone who themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person . unfortunately , is ,
when it has came down to , lately has been joy in the of for her and her husband . with a little one on the way , she has a lot to . still , ,
it is sad that when an artist has n't really brought out their best in their music . unfortunately for lady , her latest album has shown to be more of a of songs from the ,
it has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from robin . the past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life . from the ,
when it has came down to michael jackson , he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times . but honestly , it has nearly been seven years ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been ,
when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs ,
there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and ,
when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,
there is no question that like so many other r b acts for the past few years , has had the gamble to . after the past few new songs like every time the beat drops ,
hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the death of . musically , she was one of the most soulful r b in the world . yet , in the way was remembered ,
when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has ,
there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made ,
has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her ,
when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album ,
there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice ,
when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart . ,
when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse , ,
it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it ,
when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she ,
it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs ,
there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to ,
there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

hard to believe this guy is already in the middle of his second decade in music ! in his some years of recording history he 's taken us down some very interesting and often innovative and ,
in the years that both the and john legend the general world around them had actually returned to a state very similar to the way it was in the late 60 's early 70 's . ,
neither of 's first two post releases said anything all that new about his . by the time the 2000 's were nearly a decade old however was beginning to make a change . he to ,
so much controversy has been generated regarding the creative of this album that i truly believe it 's many enjoyable qualities have been . not only that but their are many excellent creative elements to this ,
it never to me how , after more than a decade and a half , that my reaction to hearing the jackson five every time provides me with more and more . what can i say ,
you know i did n't know if after his and the stopped on his if his music would survive intact . well obviously has n't gone soft one bit . it 's been a great 30 ,
it was pretty assured with his previous album ; a data hook product link linked class a link normal lost in time dp ref cm cr d ? ie utf8 lost in time a ; that ,

for the past five or six years , i 've been hearing a lot about multi instrumentalist mark and his to the funk sound that was heavily to the electro boogie sound of the late 70 ,
about five years ago , i got seriously into the whole label music scene . the whole they had was very retro . it was n't just the instrumental style of the music that came out ,

it often seems that soul , in the context of a genre of music , refers mainly to a type of singing and playing . actually you can have the right singing , the right playing ,

one thing to be said about is she 's always had the for huge creative success . a love for jazz and a heavy gospel back round have given her a vocal instrument that itself wonderfully ,
during the december of 2010 a lot of excellent r b and soul were being released at roughly the same time by , el , the the newer . i myself had always enjoyed eric since ,
ever since the end of 2013 with 's self album making a surprising on itunes ? artists as diverse as d have continued to explore the territory of releasing a surprise album for an excited public ,
the first time i ever heard of king was on a roll up of for this year . it featured a sound sample , and really enjoyed what i heard . this trio is made up ,
since so much of the music sounds so and objectively similar , it is all too easy to discount all contemporary american pop music as a waste of ones time . there are however artists in ,
one thing i 've noticed in terms of the modern day 80 's synth pop boogie funk is that it seems to stem more from electronic artists than those in the soul funk genre who actually ,

i 'm sorry to say this but this is one of the worst singles that this group has ever put out . i hate that they used an old song , yet the older song is

i love the and this with and him was something classic . i 'm not particular on this style of music exactly , but i feel like somehow it worked out . ,
despite her recent change in style and controversy , i think this track is n't too bad . her voice is a bit odd for this song ... but music is art and art is n't ,
this is a classic album by that any one could vouch for . just bought it to add to a workout mix . this worked out well . ,
love the album , love this song , love and her music ... most of all love the movie ! did an awesome job .

i like his guitar playing his versatility . but the songs themselves are pretty much there he reminds me of , , etc . . with the acoustic guitar . been there down that better in ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
is still the standard of because who else could make folks wait nearly two decades for said follow up ? now to me the will always be a standard period . and i still feel that ,
this cat has legit talent , however his material is about as as ex . i mean i have seen him on tv singing and playing drums , etc . . however his talent does n't ,
i have always enjoyed the fifth dimension . the re mastering sounds really good there voices sound strong . i heard alot of there cuts when i was a kid always remembered them . ,
de la soul a different era of hip and they were able to blend a of feel and yet be direct within a context and yet offer their own all at once . this album feels ,
i 've heard there stuff and its a cool of the sounding stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things , however they fall into a phrase called time music which works ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
always been a huge fan of the and michael jackson will always be the king of music to me and he left a mark unlike so few before or since . anyway lets get to the ,
its a cool album where some of the tracks he got some real and then its hit and miss . dig his flow and vibe and it works . in places and a cool set . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
i got this album when it first came out because i say you do . young love this album though on a whole had some moments interestingly has a more grown up vibe that alot of ,
you feel her soul and power on these . this is the real . hearing her doing gospel music is to the soul ears . a must have . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
broke r . still doing a broke take and no musical . now the cat can sing and has moments where his voice saves otherwise paint by the numbers material which leaves alot to be desired ,
kid rock is a frustrating act because just solely on the music front , he covers a few styles , problem is on an album like this he forgot the songs and settles for of what ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
straight up this cat has always had a nice voice and i his longevity from the to film , tv , etc . . cat has kept a brand going , however musically he has always ,
is a very artist to me . her voice is still something else it 's hard to believe she has been around as long as she has is only in her 40 's . she is ,
i guess if you use the formula and solo then throw a bone to and and have a 90 's vibe going on then it will make you appear as something more than the surface . ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
for as as she is and the fact she has a good sound and appeal her solo material tends to leave me rather cold . and while no doubt had good cuts and i feel they ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
its a standard album and at this point and time in her career she has stayed on course with a and its worked with where she is going and wanting to do . now her approach ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
some of these tracks feel like they been sitting in a and while he has some moments , he does n't have that modern day money track that r . always brings to him . sounds ,
this was a good soulful and feel good project . i have much respect to because she was only getting better with time and she was n't as the industry is so age struck , she ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
one of those songs which is and easy and it feels good to the ears and it still moves the feet . the harmony and the groove is on point . very soulful and a strong ,
is arguably one of the most over hyped acts over the past decade easily . when she first arrived in her post pop era she seemed like something different . you know was a but in ,
the beach boys say summer with their music and also a time period and time . this collection takes you back to a different time and a this music is truly feel good and laid back ,
this cut still goes hard and i loved the harmony and vibe of this jam . very nine 's and yet direct and its a cool song to have a crisp fall day . ,
one of those artists that had the goods , however he never got the goods . like that pro who was top tier talent , however said person either never had the right , system or ,
rare earth were a good group . i just want to is a tight jam . their take on the get ready is cool . interestingly is their take on the j five 's hum along ,
on the for real , for real it seems like musically got musically after the late 80 's and lost what once made him a force back in the day . this song is boring and ,
is one of those where i keep expecting her to go full james and expect a classic song or , etc . instead of getting her doing 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from lightweight ,
is one of the best technical sounding and he always kept a groove and of course i the old triangle base he came out of with . problem is he is a third tier version of ,
somewhere between being a broke meets a broke and a couple of other acts in places . eye candy factor she is on point , as a music artist she is almost below zero . her ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
john is a musician and overall artist , however this album feels like he went about making an album that takes away from his best strengths as a artist and feels like he settled for a ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
is still as sharp as all get up , however doing a duet with a broke in the album way down and the same goes when is singing with a broke r . in . needs ,
jackson get right all thru here . the words music have genius all over them . i have never heard a bad recording with these two great on it . very straight up at you . ,
he has some trip out jams just like the you gonna trip out on it from start to finish . i have had some of his hits for a few years if you can get into ,
really good balance of the past and present on this album . i 'm glad to see in his solo career and what an act two his solo career has been ? good combination and how ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
paul always keeps his own vibe and groove going and he is truly one of the best ever and the man stays in his and makes music stay steady with his presentation . this album finds ,
stone is one of the greatest musical ever and the bridges and path his sound and style set are still many decades and later and always will to me . and the family stone are one ,
is clearly one of the artists going today . as a songwriter , singer and musician not to mention as a live act he got his thing together . he came back with an album which ,
i like the concept but sounds just like anyone else be it or . alot of the material you can feel in the blank of where you heard it before . she still has time to ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
i have always and lady t . . no to , , etc . . however we did n't to leave these to have true blue eyed soul that stayed true to the root . never ,
this is one of george 's greatest . his playing vocals are incredible . this still shine . a must have . ,
first and foremost i always when black artists take back country music because country music is the baby of r b and gospel music . ray , and have showed you it can be done and ,
is to me . this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day . makes me think of 's closer meets 's white . is trying to channel so much , but ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
it was hit and miss in places . the best duet was with wonder and it worked . the rest are met with mixed results at best . good and production . the duet with john ,
the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she ,
they missed the boat by not having the better songs on the disc . the better cuts are all on the mp3 having said that the songs work better for the show as to their own ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
to me the hardest part of the entertainment industry is and having and making it all connect on the stage and with the pace of the music and this does that and more , its a ,
i have heard this album and i do n't get all the hype . is creative to a extent , but she sounds like trying to channel hill and it has a mixed reaction . the ,
i respect 's skills and the fact he is and , but musically when it comes to what he puts out on himself , there is alot to desired . the tracks feel like they are ,
nobody and i mean nobody is touching this soul brother when he can go from style to style and not miss a beat . i mean to radio message which echos part 's your love is ,
the brothers always seem to get right on the smooth jams . you know they are funky as all heck but they have made some of the most important ballads ever . this incredible family act ,
while knows what his sign is the month he was in , musically he is truly suffering from loss . somewhere between the early 80 's till early 90 's is where is in . while ,
michael jackson has always been period . from his days as a kid leading the to his incredible adult solo run . his vocal instrument alone has touched so many lives . his instrument of a ,
dig the police reggae influence and is the truth musically . he truly is versatile and multi and is going to be a force to be with for many years to come . and this song ,
a great on one of pop music 's most important artists ever . this is the first ever overall of his works as a solo artist and it does him musical justice . for the casual ,
the were the truth and nothing but the truth these songs still hold up really well and the and there versatility leads to that and more . in alot of ways you could n't put them ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
his music is incredible . i have listened to alot of his material . this set is a must have . his timing space is used really well here . leaves i wish i knew really ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
i 've never been that big on jewel sure did n't think she would ever try anything different so i was surprised when i heard her lead single off this set . she is still the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
sweet more than anybody else i have ever heard on a record or radio . his best jams to me were mainly on his set make it last forever . the thing is the cat had ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
this is a pretty good . i feels good , stroke with a cool to of power the family stone . the blues is tight . it never rain in southern california is a classic slow ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
love has a top notch voice and one of those vocalist with the right material could and should have been bigger . this album of material does n't add anything and it does n't capture her ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
its a cool record and right now mark is on the pulse of the music ear and him and alone got the song of the year . i mean funk alone is the jam jam right ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
he got over at a good time as a modern day broke meets a modern day broke michael jackson and it worked for a few projects and he made more of a name for himself as ,
at first i was checking to see what they might go as they have been pretty cool with their folk brand of pop music . however this album feels are for radio play . like they ,
now the dream got a ok pen game for others , however on his own , he just ai n't got alot going for him . as is the case with his previous other r . ,
rock funk all through this disc . the jams grooves never let up . the music non stop . the genius of is on full display here . more bounce to the ounce still makes heads ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,
i was curious about them after hearing there first couple of records and i did n't know they into jimmy ? i 'm hearing this album and it has polished production and some slick however the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,
the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she

this new album by comes with a gorgeous packaging , two cd 's , full lyrics , great cover and booklet art . but the music ( that 's what matters , by the way ) ,
this is an artist meant to be seen heard live , not to listen to his . they are difficult , strange . ok , one can come with the old it is outside the box ,
this cd suffered a brutal improvement with this enhanced version , when comparing it to its original cd release . the songs are more , the bass line and drums more hard , the difference is ,
man , oh man ! has paid all these reviewers to give all these false five star reviews ? even at his best moments , he never was anything close to great , and years of ,
i 've tried to like it . when i heard it was bob producing , i went for it . but ... no . nothing here . i understand the fact that these guys are old ,
there is one incredible quality in this album top production . crispy , clear , loud , . a great by guitarist !

some very enjoyable music on this one . as with any album i did n't like everything but i would suggest you pick up a copy and give it a listen . ,
heard a lot about this song getting rave reviews so i bought it . was not impressed , ok but nothing special maybe if i saw the movie it would be . ,
just ok , not really my style . some songs should not be messed with too much and think this one was ,
lots of good ( not great ) music for very little money .

i always did love the beat and of course his voice ,
i had this song on a cassette tape with four versions and it died but i was surprised when i seen it on amazon but they have supplied a lot of great songs for my tastes ,

this was my favorite of theirs from a lot of years ago . i have the 45 but it is the original so it sounds like it because i played it to death . i am ,
these old songs are really the best because i was back from that time and not hearing the cracks and pops is the best . the younger generation will probably never know what it was to ,
i like the beat especially if you have a good base to hear it on .

lil is down to earth and realistic in her music very well done but certainly not for everyone just for those who are out of their shell and not so or turned off with they probably ,
a truly touching piece of music so well written and so well performed a heart loving piece of music that can be appreciated by everyone and anyone ,
as many others , a great classic and a must have in any well rounded music collection ! good recording , great performance ! ,
this would have been a great song if this idiot did n't the of and have the to mention the name of in this song in such a horrible manner . this was completely unnecessary and

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i ,
do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the ,
keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line , ,
when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede ) ,
i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her . ,
as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 . ,
sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w . ,
i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's ,
this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format . ,
ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear ,
seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their . ,
i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me ,
yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my ,
great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out ) ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share ,
this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby ,
this s e like meets ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as . ,
although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and ,
head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the ,
it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the ,
more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these ,
the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole ,
i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart . ,
it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this ,
ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all ,
ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is ,
saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e . ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes ,
i have always been as far as liking petty 's music . yeah , i own the greatest hits album and yeah i think it 's pretty good . were there more acts that should 've ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
this song sounds like what the fat black cat that for would sound like if he did a song with the members of . this song is nothing special , sorta like a smooth silky up ,
does n't , the . chorus remind you of the people or sweaty men ? . .

i 'm a huge fan but this , this was like left over music that he should have kept left over . it was uninspiring even with the strong content . ,
eric is his status in the r b world . this man knows how to make music ... i literally still have the last album on my ipod and constantly played and now a new edition ,
the album ... absolutely excited for the album . so soulful like someone else stated , 's vocals are so powerful , the instruments , the , it 's all there and i am uber excited ,
the song is very nice . i like the lyrics . the video was n't all bad it just did n't make as much sense but i got the vibe . this song stays on repeat ,
as i live tank and this new album , it is nothing different from his last one . it 's his style and he 's good at it and i 'm not sure what else i ,
i am pretty new to sons but i took a chance to sample their sigh no more album and i agree with the low that it all sounds the same . and i will wait are ,
is he serious ! ? he is trying to be someone different and do a different style but this sucks major . i am disappointed , thank i it ! is better than this , he

love this recording . i do n't have other cd by the other two performers but is wonderful and i am a male saying this ,
she is coming to this december and i got this because i have all of her other cd 's and because i am going to go and see her live ,
it is not as good as the other cd that i have of . i did buy it but it was very cheep so i am not out anything ,
it is a great ( last ) cd of a great woman ,
i have played this nine ( or so ) times . at first i thought this is wonderful but as time when on it became very depressing . the original is much better . ,
i have wanted for this to come out and i was let down . to long to many songs it was a let down

i 've been a fan of jason since i first saw him perform with metallica in . jason has a style that i really dig . his bass playing is n't too technical but it always ,
a good track but not at all of what you 'll hear on the rest of the album . ,
i pre ordered this album and was able to download the in i and the negative one ahead of the full release date . i was beyond impressed with these tracks and was interested to see ,
i 've been listening to for three or four years now . i got started with the video and have been a fan ever since . i picked up this is and really enjoyed it for

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,
there is something that i adore about , after she left the . she had honestly grown her voice , but also showed some really great songs over a career that still . she has definitely ,
there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,
there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions ,
there is honestly so much that i can say about the lack of in music today . there are some songs worth their effort , while there are others that could be better overall for their ,
there is no doubt about the lack of traditional r b soul that has been overlooked from radio the past few years . it has not only been sad , it shows that the music industry ,
there is no doubt that this past year has been a much harder year for artists to really deliver quality songs . for yo though , he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
when it has came down to , she has had a lot of good songs , yet so many people have n't given her the real and respect that have her voice well . while so ,
there honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential , but others who just have n't made any good songs all . for , whom last year was really a bit as the i a girl ,
when it has came down to the of john , he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time . what he had done with 's lyrics , he has ,
there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her ,
when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul , ,
there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is ,
if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but ,
there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs ,
when it has came down to , she has shown a really good voice and with her songs , but not all of them have been really . her song from her first album it kills ,
honestly , it is very tough whenever someone young and , dies at a young age , and in a stage in their life . sadly , it has been 20 years since the of michael ,
it is so and sad to know that it has nearly been 35 years since the world lost an amazing and artist . john showed so much success on his own , and when he a ,
when it has come down to recently , there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like lucky for jason . but for , his recent have been a bit weak heart ,
honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the ,
it is just so sad that it would 've been 's birthday . honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years , in ,
when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her ,
when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song ,
when it has came down to , musically she has n't really had the best in her songs that have driven home to her music . sadly , the lack of heart in her basic record ,
when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a ,
when it has honestly came down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant . sadly ,
when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart , and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer . unfortunately , happens to be ,
when it has came down t ballads from the 90 's , there were very few and far between that really had the brilliance , beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into . ,
when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with ,
for , she has shown a lot of strength in her acting in her shown on with and her as a part of . but for her singing , she definitely does n't seem to show ,
there is a real difference between being a singer and a , and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die , and you 're severely . has became the ,
it has felt like ages since has released anything new . the past several years , he had , and was dropped from his label after a set of songs . so it has been awhile ,
it has been a very long time since came out with a good song that . she had done well with tell me when she was a part of theory , and had a few songs ,
when it has came down to what , she has been more of a product , than a real singer . the surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date , ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
it is absolutely so sad that has been a poor role model in her music , and her own status as a , by not only making very poor choices with her own music , but ,
it is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs . has made some of the most songs that have came out the ,
when it has came down to in her songs , she just really does n't deliver anymore in regards to voice , and soul in regards to her songs each and every time . sadly , ,
there is no words to describe the news of today that had passed away at age 57 . with a set of in r b we 've lost this year with , white of earth , ,
when it has came down to girl groups , there are n't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within . musically , it has been much ,
there are sometimes moments where a can be a strong moment for the world , or a song that has lost all of the in the world . that unfortunately is the case with the of ,
it has been nearly 15 years since recorded their classic duet the boy is mine . yet , they are both dealing with a lot of lately , and that is the death of . yet ,
there is no question that when it has came down to real artists , john has made the most dynamic and contemporary songs of the past 45 years in music . that has not only been ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to in music , she has had some songs that have been good , while others have not been able to shine in music before like she and underneath your . ,
when it has came down to right now , there are very few pleasure songs that i love listening to from the 80 's . but honestly , one of the very few songs that surprised ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young and away , that we really have felt like we have enjoyed their music beyond a lifetime and the heart has shown it . white has ,
when it has came down to the past 25 years , has simply been the most dance of all time . her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . but , unfortunately her music ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since george michael and of made it big beyond their dreams and became household names in america . musically , has ended his music career , while ,
when it has came down to , she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing , but drive in good songs either ,
with a lack of really good music coming out the past year , there still have been some surprises that 've came out this year from acts that really been getting to the . for , ,
today would have been 's birthday . she sadly passed away three one two years ago , but the heart and soul of her beautiful and voice had never lost its , while she did lose ,
when it has came down to lo , he has had some ups and as a singer . on his own or with , he just has n't been able to hit more of a . ,
when it has came down to , she has n't been fully able to deliver with striking distance with her music . while she has been very close a few times with her music , not ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had the songs to show that she can sing , yet enough know how to . the songs that she had out there , feel ,
when it has came down to robin , this past year has been a real year with his music , and the smash success of lines . but his ballads have missed the mark with though ,
it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone who is that they have constantly thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those up singers who has been more like a in her ,
it has been a very long time since came out with something new . through it all , she has been through a lot of , with her ex husband on her , and trying to ,
things personally have n't been going 's way , musically and . with the not so surprising breakup of her and , many people have wondered if could bounce back from this . while she has ,
it is so sad to know that it has been 10 years since , the lead vocalist of the lost his battle with cancer at 53 years old . while so many people have honestly turned ,
there are very few and far between male singers that today are really hitting the nail on the head with beautiful music . for sam smith , whom has been new to making music for the ,
if there is honestly one thing i adore about sam smith it is simply this , he can absolutely sing . his songs that he wrote for in the hour have been good , really good ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about a , it goes beyond what can be said . many of today 's female do not come from the heart , and they do not ,
there is no question that there is a of good music that was released in the past several years . but there really have been some surprises that were sure to knock you off your feet ,
it has been a rough past few years for . musically , she has had more hits outside of her own album , anti this past year . her work on songs like and this is ,
when it has came down to , and the hype around her music , it has been more of a than a strength in her voice . she has became so much of a product , ,
there honestly has been question about , and her album circus . while she has n't been able to score that wide appeal with all the problems she had gone through . while she has had ,
it has been a very , very long time since we 've heard anything new from keys . she has had a lot of good songs , but radio started to ignore her from her last ,
when it has came down to green day , musically they have a lot to prove in their songs since american idiot and century . sadly , i have n't heard it in the songs from ,

for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time , ,
when it has came down to michael , he has made some really good songs that have been worth their while . not only that , but unlike so many other artists of today , he ,
there always has been something that has been said about michael jackson , past and present . musically , he had shown a lot of brilliance . but personally , michael was suffering internally and that ,
it has been awhile since has came out with a good song . her last album of an was an absolute and her last song was a absolutely song . her last time she had made ,
when it has came down to lady and her talent , she actually did n't deliver in regards to the music from her record . instead , the songs have been a big of that have ,
there is honestly a difference between a , and a singer who has really been to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore , because they are severely and . unfortunately , is ,
there honestly can be so much said about the music of the 80 's . there are some songs that are really beyond the soul of the heart , and others that may make you think ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,

there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart ,
there is no question that today there has been a huge of good songs on the radio . more artists have chosen to do poor samples from distinctive songs , instead of just covering them . ,
when it has came down to new artists , they have to have the right notes and the right rhythm to make a song deliver . but when it does come down to make up and ,
when it has came down to , he has been one of the most distinctive that had ever came out in the 70 's . with he showed he was a amazing drummer , and stepped ,

there is honestly a lot that i do love about sam smith . one thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul . ,
there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in ,
it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one ,
when it has came down to keys , ultimately she has been the best artist that has came out the past decade of music . she has had the and especially the style to match in ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has honestly came down to music lately , there have been a lot more artists than good ones , and good songs from great artists . but , there is always something waiting in ,

when it has came down to , she does n't even seem to with pop music . now , she is wasted her voice and ruined her heart in her songs . ball from her album ,
it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very ,
it is so sad whenever we have a artist become so , that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside . the truth about is that she is a product ,
there is no doubt about , as he has been one of the most universal and down to earth singer for the past four decades on his own and with the . but for his latest ,
, when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being ,
it has really became clear to me that has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade . not only for her own work , but she sadly has had some ,
honestly , the past few years for robin have been very hard for him and his personal life , with the end of his to , and losing big in regards to a with his song ,
when it does come down to john legend , he has been mostly known as the next , because of his ballads like heaven knows and his single ordinary people . but , he has n't ,
there is no question that michael jackson was a one of a kind . while he was popular , he died with a very broken heart , and with nothing to show for it , with ,
it is absolutely so sad that has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record , and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a whom has been ,
when it has came down to music this past year , there have really really been very few artists that have made the mark nicely in voice and heart with their songs , than cheap surprises ,
there is no doubt that it has been nearly a decade since jason broke through musically with his single , the . yet , he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the ,
there is so much that can be said about the legacy of john , and his songs from top to bottom . yet , it is so sad that it has been 35 years since john ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since keys came out of the music industry , and has shown that her work , her voice and her style have been both ,
there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's ,
there has been no doubt that there has been a lack from the talent from american this past year , not just on the show but with those who 've been past and . for , ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and leaves this earth so soon , and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music . that has ,
there is so much that i can say about female singer of today , they sincerely do not even come from the heart . with artists like , and others have sincerely sounded more like than ,
it has been a that has n't really brought out her a game into her songs recently . with following up to all i ever wanted , has had a strong gamble to make it worth ,
when it has came down to these days , it has been more about her personal life , than the of the music she wants to sing . it is very sad that she has not ,
when it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices . , whom back up for chris brown on his michael jackson hit she ai n't you , has a lot ,
when it has came down what had shown in music , she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry . but sadly , she has been ,
there is no question that has n't been in the best of shapes musically . while people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new for american this year ,
it is absolutely awful whenever someone has became more of a product than a strong singer . pulling a surprise record to the music industry , well has had a lot of wasted songs that has ,
hard to believe today it is five years since michael jackson lost his own life the way he did . i definitely do not think michael jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a ,
there is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days . but there are those few that have been one hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that . ,
when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england , ,
when it has came down to , she has n't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted . that appeal is written all in her album . ,
there is no question that has been so , that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has away . her music has been more like a fashion of time , but ,
there is no question that today 's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart , and lost its . for acts like jason , he has had a hard time ,
when it has came down to train , they definitely have made some excellent songs over the past several years , that have continued to shine with train 's musical status , of making the kind ,
when a new artist comes out with a song , she has to really drive into her first song . for who back on chris brown 's big hit she ai n't you , which worked ,
when it has came down to , he has had some great songs over the years , on his own and as a part f the brothers . but it has been awhile since mr . ,
last year has been a big year for . with her with the stars , and being a new addition for the sing off for , she has had a bit of . musically , she ,
there is so much that can be said for in her personal life right now . the end of her relationship with her future had ended with him on her , and also her music has ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson in his lifetime , he showed a great deal of good songs , but some of the times , he had songs he had recorded , have ,
when it has came down to movie songs for , lately they honestly just have not been able to in the way they used to back years ago , and all the way through to the ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more , than really soulful on radio . unfortunately , has been one of those that does deserve more credit because of her soul ,
when it has came down to pink , she has n't really hit that nail on the head with the songs yet . after her recent breakup from her , that still has n't yet stopped ,
the past several years have been very rough for . she had a gripe with her label , and said to sony . overall , she took a step further within her voice , and tried ,
it has nearly been a decade since we 've heard anything from . musically , they have been from the scene for a long time , while did well on his brief on american . but ,
it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and striking from . she had been from making music for quite a long time , not just on her own , but ,
when it has came down to movie songs lately , they have seemed to run out of the magic . unfortunately , i believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real , human and voice , and someone who themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person . unfortunately , is ,
when it has came down to , lately has been joy in the of for her and her husband . with a little one on the way , she has a lot to . still , ,
it is sad that when an artist has n't really brought out their best in their music . unfortunately for lady , her latest album has shown to be more of a of songs from the ,
it has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from robin . the past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life . from the ,
when it has came down to michael jackson , he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times . but honestly , it has nearly been seven years ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been ,
when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs ,
there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and ,
when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,
there is no question that like so many other r b acts for the past few years , has had the gamble to . after the past few new songs like every time the beat drops ,
hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the death of . musically , she was one of the most soulful r b in the world . yet , in the way was remembered ,
when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has ,
there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made ,
has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her ,
when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album ,
there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice ,
when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart . ,
when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse , ,
it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it ,
when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she ,
it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs ,
there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to ,
there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

all the nasty out there , this music is so even when the are nasty . with the way today 's world handles everything , there is a certain that when spoken and in a no ,
when i first listen to a song i play it a few times to train the brain . as i 'm enjoying it i think it 's the greatest . but then comes overkill . when ,
how can one be from the 60 's music and not enjoy ? you will not regret this purchase ( as i did not regret it ) even if you are much , much , much ,
's music is a blast . it 's starts out of the gate with a bang and makes you want more at the end . i do n't usually like too much but this guy got ,
i 'm and old man but i think she is the 's . the girl is gorgeous . has a killer voice . only thing is she needs a better song . her music is good ,
i do n't believe yo ever makes a bad song . he 's and not into the bj thing like many of the other singers today . it gets old real fast . good r b ,
can find better songs instead of sings like this sting type song . some people should stay away from singing songs . ,
ha has been one of those artists who does t grab the both on stage or in her personal life . this is the kind of singer i enjoy . this song , as here previous ,
it 's a happy song . the beat makes you want to get up and the group on the dance floor . ,
her voice is n't even tired from all that singing like the previous . what 's great is she sounds like and even the song is in style with their . two for the price of ,
i guess i 'm really music that does n't have all the lyrics . good strong beat . one thing about ms ... it 's nice to accept a little from someone who can sing . ,
i believed she has tried to change her music also . the style has gotten old . she 's a beautiful woman and has great . it seems to me the of her music is going ,
it has good music for a man who ca n't really sing but his lyrics make up for it if you want your 14 year old learning from him about . i mean with today 's ,
her version ( alone ) is better . no please . brown is a sucker for punishment . and sooner or latter all will not be and he will stop . she has a great sound ,
it 's great ! you can understand the lyrics . has a great beat . good music . reminds me of the days when i had with the top down blasting away while keeping the speed ,
very rarely will two singers of this and voice quality get together to make a record . no just good music with a story to tell . i was surprised to tell you the truth because ,
florida has put to music in a pleasant way . it has a great beat and easy on the ears . ,
i usually do n't like metal fashioned music but this song fills a spot in my heart . every time it plays i turn the volume up all the way for my upstairs neighbor to get ,
i do n't see what his thinking is here . ok like everyone else make a record with another artist . in his case female . but wherever he got this song has me believing the ,
has really lyrics in her today music . she says her set her free . i do n't know about any body else but i do n't care too much for the side of . while ,
while her voice is no 's , she is sexy , has an ability to sing different types of r b . not too to look at either . she does n't let one down when ,
reminds me a lot of . the drummer must have been with a drum and . this is a very good of an original from , oops my just killed that memory . what a great ,
faith needs to be in the public eye a little more . i feel with the amount of women out there being better and greater in numbers ( not ) she needs to be utilizing her ,
rock . good lyrics . i liked it a lot . ,
this song is a new take on her as a singer . it is very well done . i did n't think it was her until i went to download it . with all the terrible ,
she seems to be into other areas with her lyrics but they always come back to chris brown . obviously they have put it behind and moved on to bigger and better things without the crap

first let me say i am a big fan , so this might be a little . this cd is musically is all over the place and i like it . it 's not an easy ,
better than phase one . got that funk , jazz , r b that was really missing from the previous . it really should have come out as a double cd which i believe was originally ,
great box set . the first disk is stuff that could have been on there various cd 's . quality stuff across the board from the early to later period . the second disk is a ,
this is his best solo album thus far . i loved his first album , but this tops that one . it might be all over the place musically , but it is solid music . ,
not as good as his first two cd 's . instead of the pop of the first two he heads in a more r b direction . it 's not a bad album by any means ,
musically , miss has the range of , the piano and r b skills of keys , and the of stone . she is great . buy this cd if you like any of the artists ,
a solid effort from one of the wonderful voices of the b 52 's . it a little rocker that is entertaining what more needs to be said . you wo n't be disappointed if you ,
my expectations were high after that wonderful last cd with david . however , he ( david ) ca n't seem to his voice on stage . this cd is weaker then the van halen live ,
if you own the version and your not a big fan do n't bother buying it for the couple of offered in this new set . the sound of the re master is solid , but ,
really this was his best solo album outside of . his work with velvet was solid and art of a bit too heavy for his voice . you can tell he was enjoying this and the

i 'm not normally a country music fan and i always considered her a country singer . however this album has a little bit of everything in it , making it an enjoyable experience to listen ,
not really a fan , but hey , the melody is good , the words make sense , the is solid and it is fun to sing along in the car . who has n't people ,
beautiful music and . they just go together like milk and , do n't they ? ,
classic . practically a rock . seriously , how can you not hum along , tap your feet or at least nod your head in time to the music ? ,
can really do no wrong when she sticks to the light message songs . the video makes the song appear stupid as opposed to so just close your eyes and pay attention to the words . ,
forget the weird cage fighting video that goes with this one ( seriously , is that diamond phillips ? ) the only part of that video you need to think about when listening to this song

i would rather review the whole album than each individual song that is released before the completed album is released . this is the song that got me to pre order album from brown band . ,
a good mix of early songs with his hits . this was recorded live at a pair of boston shows to support his album . it is a good recording of bob in concert . i ,
i would rather review the album as a whole than each individual song that is released before the album comes out . brown band does a great cover of jason dress blues for their release . ,
of course i was drawn in to this album by the ear worm that is all about that bass and i wanted to hear more from . after a couple of i was hum about this ,
i 've always liked this song and really enjoy the new take on a classic . right now it is the one single getting the most play on my ipod . ,
i was not that thrilled with this song at first but the more i hear it on me . ,
this band is among the first i mention when people ask me who i am listening to that they may not know yet . i 've even had some friends that , absolutely hate country music ,
just made me want the new album to be released sooner . this is an amazing song . ,

there was zero doubt that this would be a hit song for . it reminds fans of his past hits while staying current . ,
this has been a really entertaining album . i also enjoy hearing an artist try something different and has done this with the emperor . ,

i 've been enjoying this song for about a month now and wanted it for my . it will probably become a song that is played every summer . smart move . ,
this is an okay album . it by no means going to change the music industry but it is a good start for a star . it is nice to see that has had some type ,
i like the sound change that and sons is with this new single and i believe that it is just a sample of what will be another amazing album from this group . because the group ,
after seeing perform this song on the april fool 's day of the jimmy show as part of the a to wake up jimmy in the middle of the night i had to purchase . it ,
what a fantastic album ! i gave it a listen first thing in the morning and was blown away by the songs ! during i decided that i wanted to give it another listen and was ,
this album is a good listen from open track to the final song . i do n't think anyone will be disappointed by this album . i even have friends that claim to not like country ,
another good country song from . if the title song from 's next album is any indication of what is to be expected i ca n't wait to hear the complete southern style album .

a single man by john is a hard one to evaluate . on the one hand , the songs are mostly good ones ; and the production is super sweet ! very soft and understated . ,
after the but was here came six years of separation for the boys , releasing various solo in that time , only to in 1990 without . the product is edge of the century , which ,

reminds me of old time rock and roll , before so much heavy metal it , plus the video is funny . ,
was n't bad , although it kinda reminds me of paul 's work . on the fence with it , after a few more , may decide a stronger opinion . ,
interesting video , nice beat , i was surprised when i heard it , was recommended from a friend , even though i only have a mild interest in country music ,
type of music , although i like a little bit from time to time . this is n't bad . will have to look up more from these guys . ,

this is a nice song that i just had to include in my music collection . these guys were great , and to find out they 're native even better . ,
one of the few groups that come out with their own unique sound . excellent song . ,
this record was so cool ! i honestly ca n't remember any other songs from the band , but this record was great . a nice mix of funk and rock great band . ,
i love the girl groups and the great music they gave us back in the 60 's and 70 's . this is one of those songs that you probably know , but might not know ,
when i heard this on the radio , the sound of this group floored me . and his band were amazing a nice change from the tired stuff the radio was always playing . ,
i love my girl group songs , and this was up there with the best . and i 'm sorry that stations playing great music like this are getting lost to us . ,
just beautiful . the girl sings her butt off . ca n't wait to hear the rest of the album . ,
the shock is still wearing off about o 's passing . my daughter was when i told her the news she always wanted to see the band live . and this song it was both our ,
the first time i heard sing was when my daughter gave me her player to listen to . this was just after made the cover of rolling stone . i honestly had a hard time believing ,
had one of those great voices , and she put it all in this great song . and this is the version you want to get , ok ? ,
this was a get up on your feet and sing along to the fun kind of song . and of course the kids knew the all the words before we did . ,
i love my folks . this is another one that was out when i was very young , assuming i have the correct . i just think it 's a great little record glad to have ,
what can you say ? this was one of the absolute biggest hits to come out of the and funk era . a lot of hated but a lot of us fans out here could n't ,
the first time i heard this , all i wanted to do was get up and dance . this was nice and i 'm glad that the have n't forgotten it . ,
my favorite record by . was anyone else tired of hearing radio wearing out right here waiting ? not to say it was a bad song , but they over killed us with it . but ,
steve 's voice has been rocking since the days he was with the group . this was one of the best songs to come out of the 80s with a nice mix of 80s pop with ,
mr . 's voice was just so unusual and so . this was just a great song , no matter what kind of music you like . ,
my friends did n't care for the video of this record , but i always . the video told the story of the record , and the record itself was truly one of 's best . ,
by far , this is my favorite song . they have quite a few others that i like as well , but i love a great , and the late his heart out on this one ,
had one of those great voices , and she put it all in this great song . and this is the version you want to get , ok ? ,
this is such a beautiful song . and the between eric clapton and was perfect they just each other so well . the music , the words everything about this song is wonderful . ,
a great song , and very different in its time . but pulled it off in and its nice to find the full version too . ,
i was so glad to find this online i finally got to hear , which i heard about but never got to hear her sing . and on the other songs that were included , she ,
i heard this record again by accident , and just said oh yeah that was a nice record ! i had to download it love it . ,
how many of you 80 's fans out there thought it was the way sounded so much like john singing this record ? ,
i may have been young , but i still remember a lot of the girl groups . the were great glad the music is still as great . ,
i loved this when it came out , and it seemed to have been taken off radio too soon for me . and to hear it , its still hard to believe that is gone . ,
this came out after , and i loved it just as much . and the ladies sounded so wonderful on their records , with their soul sound . they were a joy to listen to on ,
this was a great song with a great classic rock song vibe to it . eric singing lead , the great sound of the lead guitar playing it 's just a great song to listen to ,
i just love this absolutely love it ! i was a bit disappointed to read in an that said she did n't like the that was added into it she actually said she would n't have ,
it was so good to finally find this on amazon . it seemed that i waited a good while . this is just a great classic rock song , from a group that was very , ,

i got the title track , and in the dark from this album . i played the crap out of this until i wore out the cassette . ,
this version is n't bad , but its not exactly the great version we heard on the radio . it was a great record , and had a great voice . ,
nick and us with this song a great hit for them finally performing their own music . and this is the full version not the cut down radio mess . great song and nick rip . ,
had one of those great voices , and she put it all in this great song . and this is the version you want to get , ok ? ,
this is one of those songs you get tired of because the do n't know when to stop wearing it out . but in the end , it 's a great little record , and i ,
it 's a greatest hits album of course its going to be great . i 'm not the biggest earth , wind , and fire fan out here , but they are a fabulous group . ,
by far , this is my favorite song . they have quite a few others that i like as well , but i love a great , and the late his heart out on this one ,
it 's a greatest hits album of course its going to be great . i 'm not the biggest earth , wind , and fire fan out here , but they are a fabulous group . ,
miss dusty left us way too soon ! she sounded so fabulous singing this . there are a few more on the album i may get as well . ,
us when she this . i will always love and 's version as well , but the arrangement that was done for , they literally helped her to make this song her own . ,
this song was one of the best movie songs ever . miss sounded great , and if i remember right , she was great in the movie too . ,
this was such a great song a refreshing surprise when it came out . funk , soul , it had it all . ,
i love my classic girl group records folks . the harmonies , the nice and easy songs you can sing along to i just love songs like this . ,
this record was so cool ! i honestly ca n't remember any other songs from the band , but this record was great . a nice mix of funk and rock great band . ,
i got the title track , and in the dark from this album . i played the crap out of this until i wore out the cassette . ,
's great voice said it all and made this song . this is one of those they should 've had more hits moments for a great sounding band and a female band at that . ,
always loved the music in this song love it . ,
this was one of those classic and songs . johnny 's voice is so beautiful , and the message the song has is great . some people may think that it 's one of those songs ,
the shock is still wearing off about o 's passing . my daughter was when i told her the news she always wanted to see the band live . and this song it was both our ,
here 's another great song that did n't get the air play from that it deserved . i 'm sorry we did n't hear more from . ,
this was one of those unexpected songs from the 70 's , from a band that we did n't know much about . they had a great style which comes through very clearly in this song ,
this was one of the 70 's songs i could n't get enough of hearing on the radio . his smooth and mellow voice just took you away . ,
i love a good , and this certainly more than qualified as a great one . too many good groups like this came and went too fast in the 80s and 90s . ,
i had to have it one of the great girl groups . my are having difficulties not sure why . i decided to just get my own cd . excellent condition all three girl group cds ,
this record was one of those great hits that told a nice and simple story that you could see in your head and you learned the words to in no time . it may be considered ,
miss dusty left us way too soon ! she sounded so fabulous singing this . there are a few more on the album i may get as well . ,
one of those great songs telling us a great story . jim definitely left us way too soon . he is still missed . ,
i just had to have for my music player and my media player collection . did a great job for a live recording . ,
this was a great girl group record , and a great record that gave praise to how much mean to each other . ,
i honestly ca n't remember hearing any more from the , but when this song came out i was pleasantly surprised and loved it . it was nice to hear that and his band have their ,
i was a kid when this came out still sounds great . ,
a great record ! the music and the funny video they put out just had you in a good mood any time you heard it playing . ,
from what i heard , the band did n't really care for this song , but you have to agree that it was a great song to sing regardless . ,
i loved this song , and the whole album in general . sounded great , and he had one of the best bands of the 80 's . ,
i 'm not the biggest hip fan , but i did like this when i first heard it . the video was on tv , and my daughter told me to come see it and hear ,
this was such a great song a refreshing surprise when it came out . funk , soul , it had it all . ,
it 's a shame . here is a five star group with only this one great song to remind us of them . ,
us when she this . i will always love and 's version as well , but the arrangement that was done for , they literally helped her to make this song her own . ,
i 'm a 70 's girl all the way great rock and roll , and great soul music . and james taylor was one of my favorites i loved his mellow voice still do . ,
one of the fabulous long lost hits from the 80 's that radio seems to have forgotten . this was a group i 'm sorry we did n't get to hear more from them .

i 've already reviewed the three parts to this album , and so i 'm doing a little cut and paste action with this review . i was n't too surprised to see that this album ,
i had never heard of far east movement before hearing this club hit on the way home from work the other night and i was just . no , this song is not brilliant , but ,
unlike some of my fellow reviewers ( okay , one of them ) , i do n't think that this song or its message will end and separation . that said ; i absolutely love this ,

with and perfectly placed , really sets the bar pretty high with the energy not your fault . with a worthy chorus ( not to mention the during the ) , this is a track that ,
has , almost overnight , become pretty in the music industry . he 's like the male equivalent of . if you want a slick vocal to lace your chorus lines , you call ( just ,
i really like . i remember when i first heard and i was instantly hooked . i love their style and their sound and 's voice is magic to my ears . he has the perfect ,
i think i 'm in love with this song . it has just continued to grow and grow on me to the point where i consider it a marvelous folk to modern music . the content ,
with the beauty and mystery of a , gravity is the perfect for the vocal ability by bright ; both and each other flawlessly . the way these two vocal wonders play off one another ( ,
i really liked what i 've heard from , but i must admit to being put off by the grungy nature of holy holy , a song that does n't quite carry the same modern edge

while this is a pretty decent , it 's just too uneven . it has far too many songs from certain and not enough from others . it 's got eight ( ! ) songs from ,
i 'm a huge mac fan , but i do n't think these four songs truly the best music they have to offer . without you is n't new at all . it 's from the ,
like others have said , if you go into this album with an open mind , and not try to compare it with the pink floyd classics of the 70 's , you will probably like ,
it goes without saying that is a genius , and his latest work is no exception . this is one of those that you really need to sit down with the lyrics and actually pay attention ,
my wife made me download this song , complaining that i do n't have enough new music ( i 'm a classic rock fan floyd , , etc . ) this is just another classic example ,
the first and second songs are pretty good , but the rest are pretty mediocre . my eight year old daughter ( who loves ) even told me she thought this cd was boring ( except

i just brought this track based on a suggestion and it turned out to be a good one i really enjoyed this track and will most likely purchase more of his music . ,
i enjoy mr . fortune music he is always telling a story and the story always have a to what is going on at the present time . ,
i love just about anything wonder does he 's very creative and he adjust to the changing times , not to mention all of his music from the past never seems to get old . i ,
mr . music is always on the money i have yet to purchase any music by him that was not great . he just keep hitting the right to sing about . ,
i wanted to hear another version besides the original and decided to purchase her version it 's okay just guess it will grow on me . ,
i just love her music it has a hint of several genres of music in it , you hear the blues and you hear jazz she 's just great . ,
ms . as usual is singing her behind off and the subject matter is excellent yes god will make a way . ,
i 've enjoyed everything by mr . fortune thus far no complaints he 's been putting out good music from the start and i trust he will only get better . ,
i love this song both these artist compliment each other very well as if though they were and actual couple outside of the studio . i look forward to hearing more from these two . ,
a change of pace from all the regular radio music and quite , good for winding down after a long day . ,
i like this group just wish that they produced more music , this was a good album though . it would be nice to hear from them again hopefully in the near future they will put ,
mr . and mr . are members in the gospel i love anything either of them put out their music says it all .

every song on this ep album is great . they are each different in their own way . i 'm surprised three 16 is the least popular because that 's one of my favorites . but ,
i did n't like this song at first listen but it really grew on me . love it ! ,
i 've been a fan of for years now . i found out about her when i heard on the radio back in 2012 i believe . i thought her voice was so unique and powerful ,
with , tried giving us a completely different sound style , and i think it 's pretty , regardless of what the sales say , that not too many people are liking it . however , ,
giving this album two stars is being nice . not to mention her voice just gets so irritating after a while . f love , bounce , and work are good songs . black is okay ,
this song , in my opinion . if the chorus were to be completely different , this song would be a lot better . however , the entire song sounds nearly identical to problem . i ,
um ... ok i 'm not sorry , but this album is not that great . what are y all listening to ? ? i wanna listen to that album ! like damn no but seriously ,
i hope there is more coming because in my honest opinion , this is 's worst piece of work to date . it 's not a horrible album overall , but where are the hits ? ,
's are . this track is great . ca n't wait for her to release more new music !

one of my favorites in the 99 series from amazon . plenty of variety in types of work . very glad to have it . ,
i already owned some of works . this set rounds out and puts all in one place . the quality of the performances is excellent . super , exceptional for before bed . ,
i probably have about 90 percent of the tracks on this collection . it would take me hours to put together a play list . this album takes all the work away . i have been ,
i listen to mostly , so this was a little different for me . it was actually very good to have the difference from just instruments . the solo singers are great . ,
has been one of favorite . i have a good deal of his work already , but it is nice to have it all in one place . i play his work many times a week ,
this is one of my top five . many of the tracks are quite familiar and are often heard in a none classical setting . ,
i had not been aware of this , but very glad that i bought this collection . definite influence and quite . ,
i liked this very much . i did n't care for some of the tracks having applause at the end , but the music did n't sound bad for a live recording . ,
i have really enjoyed this collection . the only thing that requires a little work , is that the various are mixed up . to hear a specific , you would need to create a for ,
excellent collection . ,
great collection . i had about half of the music , but is easier to get all music in one place then trying to make a . ,
i most likely have 50 percent of these tracks , but they are all mixed up with other types of music . for me to organize from my other music it would take me hours . ,
i was surprised at the number of familiar tracks on this . the set has become one of my to four or six favorites . very high quality .

this is a good song that brings back a lot of good memories and is n't that what it 's all about ! ,
simply fantastic , one of my favorite songs . ,
this is santana at his best . the song and musicians are top shelf . he is one of the all time best in my book ! ,
wow , another blast from the past . this is a good song to use during a workout in the gym also ! ,
these are the original songs by original artists and not some studio group or a . so many cd 's are offered and many are just plain garbage . you really need to check who is ,
this music is all about the same . i really do n't find to much in it . however , i have tried pan flute music and i do get a much better response . ,
good tune . ,
good music , great artist . most of her hit songs are on this cd . you like country , you will like this cd . ,

i have found that a lot of this and music ( without ) just do n't cut it for its intended purpose . it has been my experience that pan flute music has the and effect ,
not a bad song , kind of in the beginning . ,

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,
there is something that i adore about , after she left the . she had honestly grown her voice , but also showed some really great songs over a career that still . she has definitely ,
there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,
there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions ,
there is honestly so much that i can say about the lack of in music today . there are some songs worth their effort , while there are others that could be better overall for their ,
there is no doubt about the lack of traditional r b soul that has been overlooked from radio the past few years . it has not only been sad , it shows that the music industry ,
there is no doubt that this past year has been a much harder year for artists to really deliver quality songs . for yo though , he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
when it has came down to , she has had a lot of good songs , yet so many people have n't given her the real and respect that have her voice well . while so ,
there honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential , but others who just have n't made any good songs all . for , whom last year was really a bit as the i a girl ,
when it has came down to the of john , he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time . what he had done with 's lyrics , he has ,
there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her ,
when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul , ,
there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is ,
if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but ,
there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs ,
when it has came down to , she has shown a really good voice and with her songs , but not all of them have been really . her song from her first album it kills ,
honestly , it is very tough whenever someone young and , dies at a young age , and in a stage in their life . sadly , it has been 20 years since the of michael ,
it is so and sad to know that it has nearly been 35 years since the world lost an amazing and artist . john showed so much success on his own , and when he a ,
when it has come down to recently , there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like lucky for jason . but for , his recent have been a bit weak heart ,
honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the ,
it is just so sad that it would 've been 's birthday . honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years , in ,
when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her ,
when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song ,
when it has came down to , musically she has n't really had the best in her songs that have driven home to her music . sadly , the lack of heart in her basic record ,
when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a ,
when it has honestly came down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant . sadly ,
when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart , and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer . unfortunately , happens to be ,
when it has came down t ballads from the 90 's , there were very few and far between that really had the brilliance , beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into . ,
when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with ,
for , she has shown a lot of strength in her acting in her shown on with and her as a part of . but for her singing , she definitely does n't seem to show ,
there is a real difference between being a singer and a , and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die , and you 're severely . has became the ,

when it has came down to pop music right now , it has definitely gone to be pretty lately for so many younger female acts . with songs from , and now with ha , there ,
when it has came down to what the family has tried to do with music , none of them have delivered as strongly as did with in songs and heart . for to follow what did ,

there is no question about , and the she had to personally to as a single mom , and with the appeal of being as a artist . but , when it had came down to ,
i am not a huge fan of heavy metal , but honestly it is very surprising to take a spin of great covers . when i heard about , i was not really a huge fan ,
there is no question that chris brown has been through a lot in the . after being labeled as a girl beater from his with for a long while , he has really went through his ,
when it has really came down to jason , he actually has been making some songs that have absolutely delivered , not just in great melody , but keeps up showing why the best songs have ,

for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time , ,
when it has came down to michael , he has made some really good songs that have been worth their while . not only that , but unlike so many other artists of today , he ,
there always has been something that has been said about michael jackson , past and present . musically , he had shown a lot of brilliance . but personally , michael was suffering internally and that ,
it has been awhile since has came out with a good song . her last album of an was an absolute and her last song was a absolutely song . her last time she had made ,
when it has came down to lady and her talent , she actually did n't deliver in regards to the music from her record . instead , the songs have been a big of that have ,
there is honestly a difference between a , and a singer who has really been to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore , because they are severely and . unfortunately , is ,
there honestly can be so much said about the music of the 80 's . there are some songs that are really beyond the soul of the heart , and others that may make you think ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
it has been a very long time since came out with new music . but nevertheless , he wanted his work in his songs to be his way , and not the way of what the ,
there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart ,
there is no question that today there has been a huge of good songs on the radio . more artists have chosen to do poor samples from distinctive songs , instead of just covering them . ,
when it has came down to new artists , they have to have the right notes and the right rhythm to make a song deliver . but when it does come down to make up and ,
when it has came down to , he has been one of the most distinctive that had ever came out in the 70 's . with he showed he was a amazing drummer , and stepped ,
when it has came to , she has had her own sound , her own class and a real and respect for soul r b music that back t the days of james brown , as ,
there is honestly a lot that i do love about sam smith . one thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul . ,
there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in ,
it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one ,
when it has came down to keys , ultimately she has been the best artist that has came out the past decade of music . she has had the and especially the style to match in ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has honestly came down to music lately , there have been a lot more artists than good ones , and good songs from great artists . but , there is always something waiting in ,
this past year so far , we 've have lost a lot of that really did know the strength of making great music with the of david and . but also , we 've seen a ,
when it has came down to , her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile . it has been a very long while since she came out with new songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and , really has thrown their own career away . for , she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real ,
hard to believe it has been two years since the world has lost an iconic legend , . but nevertheless , her voice will always past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson had delivered in music for the good and for the bad , he left a remarkable legacy in music that will never be , just like his ,
when it has came down to , she does n't even seem to with pop music . now , she is wasted her voice and ruined her heart in her songs . ball from her album ,
it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very ,
it is so sad whenever we have a artist become so , that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside . the truth about is that she is a product ,
there is no doubt about , as he has been one of the most universal and down to earth singer for the past four decades on his own and with the . but for his latest ,
, when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being ,
it has really became clear to me that has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade . not only for her own work , but she sadly has had some ,
honestly , the past few years for robin have been very hard for him and his personal life , with the end of his to , and losing big in regards to a with his song ,
when it does come down to john legend , he has been mostly known as the next , because of his ballads like heaven knows and his single ordinary people . but , he has n't ,
there is no question that michael jackson was a one of a kind . while he was popular , he died with a very broken heart , and with nothing to show for it , with ,
it is absolutely so sad that has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record , and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a whom has been ,
when it has came down to music this past year , there have really really been very few artists that have made the mark nicely in voice and heart with their songs , than cheap surprises ,
there is no doubt that it has been nearly a decade since jason broke through musically with his single , the . yet , he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the ,
there is so much that can be said about the legacy of john , and his songs from top to bottom . yet , it is so sad that it has been 35 years since john ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since keys came out of the music industry , and has shown that her work , her voice and her style have been both ,
there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's ,
there has been no doubt that there has been a lack from the talent from american this past year , not just on the show but with those who 've been past and . for , ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and leaves this earth so soon , and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music . that has ,
there is so much that i can say about female singer of today , they sincerely do not even come from the heart . with artists like , and others have sincerely sounded more like than ,
it has been a that has n't really brought out her a game into her songs recently . with following up to all i ever wanted , has had a strong gamble to make it worth ,
when it has came down to these days , it has been more about her personal life , than the of the music she wants to sing . it is very sad that she has not ,
when it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices . , whom back up for chris brown on his michael jackson hit she ai n't you , has a lot ,
when it has came down what had shown in music , she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry . but sadly , she has been ,
there is no question that has n't been in the best of shapes musically . while people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new for american this year ,
it is absolutely awful whenever someone has became more of a product than a strong singer . pulling a surprise record to the music industry , well has had a lot of wasted songs that has ,
hard to believe today it is five years since michael jackson lost his own life the way he did . i definitely do not think michael jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a ,
there is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days . but there are those few that have been one hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that . ,
when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england , ,
when it has came down to , she has n't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted . that appeal is written all in her album . ,
there is no question that has been so , that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has away . her music has been more like a fashion of time , but ,
there is no question that today 's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart , and lost its . for acts like jason , he has had a hard time ,
when it has came down to train , they definitely have made some excellent songs over the past several years , that have continued to shine with train 's musical status , of making the kind ,
when a new artist comes out with a song , she has to really drive into her first song . for who back on chris brown 's big hit she ai n't you , which worked ,
when it has came down to , he has had some great songs over the years , on his own and as a part f the brothers . but it has been awhile since mr . ,
last year has been a big year for . with her with the stars , and being a new addition for the sing off for , she has had a bit of . musically , she ,
there is so much that can be said for in her personal life right now . the end of her relationship with her future had ended with him on her , and also her music has ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson in his lifetime , he showed a great deal of good songs , but some of the times , he had songs he had recorded , have ,
when it has came down to movie songs for , lately they honestly just have not been able to in the way they used to back years ago , and all the way through to the ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more , than really soulful on radio . unfortunately , has been one of those that does deserve more credit because of her soul ,
when it has came down to pink , she has n't really hit that nail on the head with the songs yet . after her recent breakup from her , that still has n't yet stopped ,
the past several years have been very rough for . she had a gripe with her label , and said to sony . overall , she took a step further within her voice , and tried ,
it has nearly been a decade since we 've heard anything from . musically , they have been from the scene for a long time , while did well on his brief on american . but ,
it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and striking from . she had been from making music for quite a long time , not just on her own , but ,
when it has came down to movie songs lately , they have seemed to run out of the magic . unfortunately , i believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real , human and voice , and someone who themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person . unfortunately , is ,
when it has came down to , lately has been joy in the of for her and her husband . with a little one on the way , she has a lot to . still , ,
it is sad that when an artist has n't really brought out their best in their music . unfortunately for lady , her latest album has shown to be more of a of songs from the ,
it has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from robin . the past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life . from the ,
when it has came down to michael jackson , he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times . but honestly , it has nearly been seven years ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been ,
when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs ,
there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and ,
when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,
there is no question that like so many other r b acts for the past few years , has had the gamble to . after the past few new songs like every time the beat drops ,
hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the death of . musically , she was one of the most soulful r b in the world . yet , in the way was remembered ,
when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has ,
there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made ,
has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her ,
when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album ,
there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice ,
when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart . ,
when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse , ,
it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it ,
when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she ,
it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs ,
there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to ,
there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

ill be the first to admit that i do not really listen to this type of music , but this song is so good ! it 's even better than up kicks . ,
forever by ft . , lil wayne , and , is one of hip 's most , and brilliant songs ever produced . 's part is by far the best , following by , then , ,
i have enjoyed all of her previous songs , but this song takes the throne as the best . the addition of the , the melody and video , and the fact that it is for ,
rock that body is one of the best songs from the i love 's parts in this song ( she has a high voice , sounds like a sorta ) . this is to be their ,
this song is decent , but not good enough for my ipod . in my opinion it sounds like any other song on the radio . has a good voice but this song does n't impress ,
this song is great . the first half is really good , but once it gets to the middle ( around two 30 ) , the song is insane . the beats are awesome . i ,
i liked her previous singles but this has to be one of her worst that she 's put out . i hear it constantly on the radio and it 's making me like it even less ,
ever since they played this song during the 2012 , this song has been on repeat . not only is it a great song , i love how it brings me back to the , specifically ,
starting off slow , this song turns into a power house song once the chorus comes . this song is very well written . it 's about her times with her band , her producer , ,
i heard this song when some girl made it through to on this of american , and i wanted to know what it was called so i can download it . i found it and it ,
i heard this song when some girl made it through to on this of american , and i wanted to know what it was called so i can download it . i found it and it ,
this song is so and i heard it before it became a single , and i was glad to see it would become a single . one of her best songs . ,
this is an average song . i basically like most of it except for the chorus ( dance the night away ... etc ... ) . the beginning is pretty and i like 's parts . ,
as a fan of animal ( well most of it ) , she returns with this amazing single . the lyrics are decent this time around and she still delivers a killer beat . no other ,
boom boom is one of most songs . why so much people hate it , i have no idea . this was my favorite song for a while . it deserved to be one for all ,
my friends are all with this song , so i listened to it and so did i . it starts off slow , then gets to a faster chorus . the chorus is brilliant ! i ,
is on a roll with putting out great songs . this is one of her best , especially after watching the great video ! ,
i was n't a big fan of , but i really like this song . it 's very and most people hate it because it uses auto tone , but i do n't really mind it

it is an easy folk style song about a couple going off to rock to do their . i gave it a three star because it is a song that is fine to listen to for ,
starts out a little , but ! when he gets going he may make you want to cry . near the end of the song surprisingly he picks up the pace , the tone of his ,
if you love the ocean the crashing of it s waves and the sounds of the various birds , wow you will really love these sounds . i get so . ,
i cant listen to this song without some part of my body moving to the music . if you like the sample your going to like the entire song . ,
song has a nice beat not slow and no fast . good music and vocal . if you like r b you will like this song . a nice addition to any library . ,
i would have given it a five but the background beat is just to loud for me , it takes away from the song . however the song is such a nice one i look past ,
there is such a variety of music in this album . you will get to experience the wide range of music this band is capable of doing . ,
i like rock and soft rock . for me this song fall under the soft rock . i do enjoy this song , it has a great and the words can all be understood . jason ,
sam smith 's song can make your heart hurt . this is a little up beat song , that , will make some part of your body move to the beat . i recommend this song ,
it is an easy rock song . it is one you can listen to over and over and not get tired of it . i like rocks . i could never remember who this until i ,
if you like the sample , your going to like the rest of the song . i like rock , this song is easy for me to listen to . ,
soft rock very easy to listen to . i am not sorry i purchased this song . i enjoy the rock music of all types . singer has a pleasant voice , music has a nice ,
i do n't like a live version of a song on my computer . after i realized i did purchase a live song , i it . this is no reflection on the song itself . ,
and blues or a soft rock is how i for this song . i really do enjoy this one . i do think he does say say , whats on your mind , too many times

basically , if you liked , the power of one you will probably like this album . i would say it is a small step below the power of one , but still good none the ,
there is nothing special about this album ... at all ; it is simply ok . the group is not doing anything that has not already been done before , and did not do anything in ,
this is a j style album for sure . i really appreciate j for having a contemporary type sound , but yet not getting too carried away with it . i generally like more traditional gospel

this song was one of the for any garage band ... along with you really got me ... and several of the tunes ... crank this one up ! ,
made their bone writing pop songs for others ( most notably the ) ... thankfully , they kept this one in house for themselves ... because they nailed it on this tune ... i especially enjoy ,
this is one of top five ... creative , varied , excellent ... had it on vinyl since it 's release ... had the original issue cd , now buying this version ... this was wood ,
a steady consistent group of songs ... not great ... but being their , they have improved greatly with each album ... like all artists , they have to start ... and this is that point ,
after his first solo album ... the superb in this town ... i was firmly convinced that was the superior one in the writing team ... now in 2012 , i 'm not so sure ... ,
i would hear this song from time to time on music choice , and always would say to myself i have to obtain this song on some available format ... but i never followed through . ,
this is a song that never gets old ... stands out as the best squeeze ever produced ... maybe the best song that came out of the 80s ! ,
not many songs made as good a use of a b three organ as these guys did in 66 ... it creates a type feeling ... layered on top of a garage rock beat ... any

is flat out one of the greatest country stars alive or dead . if you are into new pop country you should get at least this greatest hits collection and a real on what a real ,
my band decided to start covering this ridiculous excuse for a song so i bought the long version . big mistake , i should have bought the radio edit and prevented myself from having to sing

i like his guitar playing his versatility . but the songs themselves are pretty much there he reminds me of , , etc . . with the acoustic guitar . been there down that better in ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
is still the standard of because who else could make folks wait nearly two decades for said follow up ? now to me the will always be a standard period . and i still feel that ,
this cat has legit talent , however his material is about as as ex . i mean i have seen him on tv singing and playing drums , etc . . however his talent does n't ,
i have always enjoyed the fifth dimension . the re mastering sounds really good there voices sound strong . i heard alot of there cuts when i was a kid always remembered them . ,
de la soul a different era of hip and they were able to blend a of feel and yet be direct within a context and yet offer their own all at once . this album feels ,
i 've heard there stuff and its a cool of the sounding stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things , however they fall into a phrase called time music which works ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
always been a huge fan of the and michael jackson will always be the king of music to me and he left a mark unlike so few before or since . anyway lets get to the ,
its a cool album where some of the tracks he got some real and then its hit and miss . dig his flow and vibe and it works . in places and a cool set . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
i got this album when it first came out because i say you do . young love this album though on a whole had some moments interestingly has a more grown up vibe that alot of ,
you feel her soul and power on these . this is the real . hearing her doing gospel music is to the soul ears . a must have . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
broke r . still doing a broke take and no musical . now the cat can sing and has moments where his voice saves otherwise paint by the numbers material which leaves alot to be desired ,
kid rock is a frustrating act because just solely on the music front , he covers a few styles , problem is on an album like this he forgot the songs and settles for of what ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
straight up this cat has always had a nice voice and i his longevity from the to film , tv , etc . . cat has kept a brand going , however musically he has always ,
is a very artist to me . her voice is still something else it 's hard to believe she has been around as long as she has is only in her 40 's . she is ,
i guess if you use the formula and solo then throw a bone to and and have a 90 's vibe going on then it will make you appear as something more than the surface . ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
for as as she is and the fact she has a good sound and appeal her solo material tends to leave me rather cold . and while no doubt had good cuts and i feel they ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
its a standard album and at this point and time in her career she has stayed on course with a and its worked with where she is going and wanting to do . now her approach ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
some of these tracks feel like they been sitting in a and while he has some moments , he does n't have that modern day money track that r . always brings to him . sounds ,
this was a good soulful and feel good project . i have much respect to because she was only getting better with time and she was n't as the industry is so age struck , she ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
one of those songs which is and easy and it feels good to the ears and it still moves the feet . the harmony and the groove is on point . very soulful and a strong ,
is arguably one of the most over hyped acts over the past decade easily . when she first arrived in her post pop era she seemed like something different . you know was a but in ,
the beach boys say summer with their music and also a time period and time . this collection takes you back to a different time and a this music is truly feel good and laid back ,
this cut still goes hard and i loved the harmony and vibe of this jam . very nine 's and yet direct and its a cool song to have a crisp fall day . ,
one of those artists that had the goods , however he never got the goods . like that pro who was top tier talent , however said person either never had the right , system or ,
rare earth were a good group . i just want to is a tight jam . their take on the get ready is cool . interestingly is their take on the j five 's hum along ,
on the for real , for real it seems like musically got musically after the late 80 's and lost what once made him a force back in the day . this song is boring and ,
is one of those where i keep expecting her to go full james and expect a classic song or , etc . instead of getting her doing 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from lightweight ,
is one of the best technical sounding and he always kept a groove and of course i the old triangle base he came out of with . problem is he is a third tier version of ,
somewhere between being a broke meets a broke and a couple of other acts in places . eye candy factor she is on point , as a music artist she is almost below zero . her ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
john is a musician and overall artist , however this album feels like he went about making an album that takes away from his best strengths as a artist and feels like he settled for a ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
is still as sharp as all get up , however doing a duet with a broke in the album way down and the same goes when is singing with a broke r . in . needs ,
jackson get right all thru here . the words music have genius all over them . i have never heard a bad recording with these two great on it . very straight up at you . ,
he has some trip out jams just like the you gonna trip out on it from start to finish . i have had some of his hits for a few years if you can get into ,
really good balance of the past and present on this album . i 'm glad to see in his solo career and what an act two his solo career has been ? good combination and how ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
paul always keeps his own vibe and groove going and he is truly one of the best ever and the man stays in his and makes music stay steady with his presentation . this album finds ,
stone is one of the greatest musical ever and the bridges and path his sound and style set are still many decades and later and always will to me . and the family stone are one ,
is clearly one of the artists going today . as a songwriter , singer and musician not to mention as a live act he got his thing together . he came back with an album which ,
i like the concept but sounds just like anyone else be it or . alot of the material you can feel in the blank of where you heard it before . she still has time to ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
i have always and lady t . . no to , , etc . . however we did n't to leave these to have true blue eyed soul that stayed true to the root . never ,
this is one of george 's greatest . his playing vocals are incredible . this still shine . a must have . ,
first and foremost i always when black artists take back country music because country music is the baby of r b and gospel music . ray , and have showed you it can be done and ,
is to me . this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day . makes me think of 's closer meets 's white . is trying to channel so much , but ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
it was hit and miss in places . the best duet was with wonder and it worked . the rest are met with mixed results at best . good and production . the duet with john ,
the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she ,
they missed the boat by not having the better songs on the disc . the better cuts are all on the mp3 having said that the songs work better for the show as to their own ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
to me the hardest part of the entertainment industry is and having and making it all connect on the stage and with the pace of the music and this does that and more , its a ,
i have heard this album and i do n't get all the hype . is creative to a extent , but she sounds like trying to channel hill and it has a mixed reaction . the ,
i respect 's skills and the fact he is and , but musically when it comes to what he puts out on himself , there is alot to desired . the tracks feel like they are ,
nobody and i mean nobody is touching this soul brother when he can go from style to style and not miss a beat . i mean to radio message which echos part 's your love is ,
the brothers always seem to get right on the smooth jams . you know they are funky as all heck but they have made some of the most important ballads ever . this incredible family act ,
while knows what his sign is the month he was in , musically he is truly suffering from loss . somewhere between the early 80 's till early 90 's is where is in . while ,
michael jackson has always been period . from his days as a kid leading the to his incredible adult solo run . his vocal instrument alone has touched so many lives . his instrument of a ,
dig the police reggae influence and is the truth musically . he truly is versatile and multi and is going to be a force to be with for many years to come . and this song ,
a great on one of pop music 's most important artists ever . this is the first ever overall of his works as a solo artist and it does him musical justice . for the casual ,
the were the truth and nothing but the truth these songs still hold up really well and the and there versatility leads to that and more . in alot of ways you could n't put them ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
his music is incredible . i have listened to alot of his material . this set is a must have . his timing space is used really well here . leaves i wish i knew really ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
i 've never been that big on jewel sure did n't think she would ever try anything different so i was surprised when i heard her lead single off this set . she is still the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
sweet more than anybody else i have ever heard on a record or radio . his best jams to me were mainly on his set make it last forever . the thing is the cat had ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
this is a pretty good . i feels good , stroke with a cool to of power the family stone . the blues is tight . it never rain in southern california is a classic slow ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
love has a top notch voice and one of those vocalist with the right material could and should have been bigger . this album of material does n't add anything and it does n't capture her ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
its a cool record and right now mark is on the pulse of the music ear and him and alone got the song of the year . i mean funk alone is the jam jam right ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
he got over at a good time as a modern day broke meets a modern day broke michael jackson and it worked for a few projects and he made more of a name for himself as ,
at first i was checking to see what they might go as they have been pretty cool with their folk brand of pop music . however this album feels are for radio play . like they ,
now the dream got a ok pen game for others , however on his own , he just ai n't got alot going for him . as is the case with his previous other r . ,
rock funk all through this disc . the jams grooves never let up . the music non stop . the genius of is on full display here . more bounce to the ounce still makes heads ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,
i was curious about them after hearing there first couple of records and i did n't know they into jimmy ? i 'm hearing this album and it has polished production and some slick however the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,

the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she

softly spoken electronic ! ten songs , both female male vocals with a two part instrumental ! deserves a seven star rating ! ! ,
my favorite album of ! plugged in with god on their side ! they cover a lot of issues in life with their songs ! a treat of a gift for that someone special in your ,
tracks total ! a multi group of a round of acoustic , alternative , christian , electronic , rock ! ! ,
ten tracks of early career blues rock from this now legendary guitar vocals artist ! not as well as her latter releases , but well worth giving a listen to ! ! ,
11 delightful tracks of electronic ! some with others with vocals ! ranging from to beats ! check out 's stuff , when you have a chance ! ! ,
downright broken depressing songs ! there are two guitar jams , on this release ! not my cup o ! ! ,
bought this for the hits , but found several other tracks pleasing ! songs to move your heart by ! ! ,
an excellent christian singer her music is darn good too ! even loved the lesser known mellow tracks ! would recommend this album to any of my fellow ! these 12 tracks deserve a six star ,
almost as great as her cd ! she addresses many of the problems facing , not so perfect ladies in ! more than just a few hits , though i enjoyed the hits too ! ! ,
the hit off this album was really good ! unfortunately it 's followed by ten tracks of mediocre ! still a band to watch progress ! ! ,
some of the best rock i 've ever heard ! the first 11 tracks really rock out , with a 12th track acoustic banjo ! a pleasant surprise probably deserves a six star rating ! ! ,
11 tracks of ambient with club beats ! something new about this release , but most of it is so mellow ! male female vocals ! ! ,
ten brief tracks of retro metal ! sounds like axl rose meets classic black sabbath ! ! ,
11 quick tracks from this pop neo soul band ! a few tracks have good dance rhythms a few have good sax ! ! ,
these twelve tracks of slightly , alternative are quite ! enjoyed it it deserves all five stars ! ! ,
her best of blues rock ! twelve tracks with few good rock n roll dance beats ! easily deserves a seven star rating ! ! ,
easy to listen to electro pop pop ! wrote 13 tracks of prime entertainment ! ! ,
10 tracks by this bluesy , , rock folk band ! the first five are primarily electric guitar , while the final five are more acoustic ! ! ,
11 brief folk rock tracks of acoustic guitars , male vocals , piano drum ! the first half of the album is not quite as light as the latter tracks ! ! ,
13 brief tracks of dream pop like alternative with some hall vocals ! they sound like 80 90 's music ! ! ,
this 's latest nine tracks are great ! this release contains another dose of his now famous of sexy club ready pop , soul blend ! ! ,
post punk with a hint of ! better than green day or lit ! deserves a six star rating ! ! ,
sorry , country music is n't my usual ! not sure exactly how i came to purchase this ! for country it 's not bad , i guess ! ! ,
electro pop with a hint of ! mainly female vocals with lyrics too vague to what they 're about ! a few dance tracks while others on dream pop ! audio candy ! ! ,
an excellent album ! good christian based rock n roll like their old stuff ! of course , which was a poor attempt at electronic mixed with ! deserves a six star rating ! what a ,
quick tracks of ! so much like the black keys that i 'm ! this release deserves a seven star rating ! ! ,
this band many types of rock music ! though they are quite , they lack the of more popular bands ! does n't seem that they 've found their niche quite yet ! ! ,
10 brief tracks of superb r b pop ! probably what dan would sound like on ! good slow music with a reggae beat on one track ! ! ,
this band covers a wide variety of modern genres ! more vocals than their first release which was exquisite also ! ! ,
even better than his first release , as he keeps getting better better ! even liked the hip track , as many of these pop tracks are quite ready dance music ! deserves a six star ,
the 16 tracks by this blues man really show his multi talent ! they truly reveal every aspect of the blues dance beats , funk , , rock , standard ! any fan of the blues ,
mellow alternative that sounds like it came from the latter 80 's or early 90 's ! found most of quite boring ! ! ,
a lil something for everyone ! , hip , electronic , reggae ! a ! deserves a six star rating ! ! ,
vocals on one track only a single track of semi dance worthy ! really , i was n't impressed with it ! ! ,
superb music with female vocals ! hidden acoustic title track at the end of 13 ! this album deserves a six star rating ! ! ,
these are boring , ! they could be stars and go far , if they just did n't have to sound so ! ! ,
nine brief country based songs ! he in jazz , country rock with , strings , etc . includes a cover of a song ! ! ,
pretty good pop rock ! the first track is intentionally blank , followed by ten tunes ! ! ,
what can i say ? one of their finest nearly as good as their ! contains several of their pop singles ! ! ,
this british band has their own sound going on ! the closest i come to describing their sound , would be to compare them to great retro rockers , such as the stone roses ! this ,
pretty good though kinda ! mainly female vocals with a few tracks ! still , i liked the guitars keyboard in a few of them ! ! ,
these two artists music is a lot like lush of the early 1990 's . ! ,
excellent ! but , why would n't it be , considering that they practically invented back in the 80 's ! deserves a six star rating ! ! ,
fast , electronic jack music with lots of artists ! not ! lots of dance beats much better than some less recent jack ! ! ,
exquisite ! some of the best electronic music i 've ever heard ! loads of good dance beats ! these ten tracks deserve a seven star rating ! ! ,
13 tracks of good old rock n roll ! lengthy open , 11 is a cover 12 is lengthy ! much better than their ! !

2 rock it out . i like tom petty and mike . they are very rock and rollers . this odd picture of two arguing me to the album , it is ok , but nothing ,
the are three that grew up playing music together , this song if i die young is quite impressive . they have a five song ep available as a download . their beautiful lead singer , ,
this a poor effort for real bluegrass , i can think of so many bands that have made better bluegrass cds this year , , the , to start with . this will work on ,

i 'll start right off the bat and say ac dc live special edition released in is my all time favorite ac dc album , live or recorded , so of this one here was not ,
it was a late night , and i was watching the david show when these guys where introduced to play a song on the show . and judging by the look of them , i was ,
i hated to rate kid rock 's last album free so low , but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic , it may have gone to one ,
being forced to listen to . one fm everyday at work by a who thinks he is a dj , and thinks everyone loves the top 40 , i have to hear the same ten top ,
the heavy return with a heavy hitting album in . like most , i 've been a fan ever since these guys on the late show with where they played how you like me now and ,
can someone explain to me why this crap gets played every day on the hour on radio stations ? especially rock stations that should n't be playing this anyway , it 's not rock . just ,
i ca n't express how much i absolutely hate this song and it should be a contender for the one most irritating song of 2012 . most people would just say , do n't listen to ,
do n't get me wrong , i am a big fan of and james , but i do n't giving four or five stars just because i like the group or artist . this album here ,
man i hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed . the hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by . that might be ,
well , the single track f it is almost a , but more an alternate version of that song by that who i do n't care i love it with the chorus changed up a bit ,
like always , i could n't wait to hear this album , and like the last three , it 's been a huge disappointment . with that said tho , even the last couple of had ,
wow . where did this band come from and why has it taken me so long to find them ? this group is heavily by all the bands i love , in particular ac dc , ,
after loving most of the tracks from the last warrant album , again ( ) i was that on that album the band had ( and thankfully ) gone back to playing hard rock music then ,
just recently i purchased rob latest live dvd , and now a week later rob 's little brother releases his first album since 2011 . i 've always been more of a casual fan of these ,
is the long release of the songs ac dc had mostly had only released as b sides to singles , but never found there way onto an actual album . mostly every ac dc collector already

i remember back in st . of 2000 and hearing this , it just the whole day , and i could n't get it out of my head . i want to make this review short ,
hi person checking this out , this is simply an offer you ca n't refuse ! hey , these songs are so cool , and i remember you can get cds , vinyl , and mp3 ,
i remember being at a store where they that all vinyl ( mostly easy listening and gospel ) was zero . 01 cent each . also listening to a good cd i 've gotten for one ,
they really like it , big kids and stuff , they like playing around and listening to it ,
i really enjoyed this because it 's very with nothing else but him and the he did . i really think it was cool with the , the book of john , and many other .

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,

when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,

there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,
there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions ,
there is honestly so much that i can say about the lack of in music today . there are some songs worth their effort , while there are others that could be better overall for their ,
there is no doubt about the lack of traditional r b soul that has been overlooked from radio the past few years . it has not only been sad , it shows that the music industry ,
there is no doubt that this past year has been a much harder year for artists to really deliver quality songs . for yo though , he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
when it has came down to , she has had a lot of good songs , yet so many people have n't given her the real and respect that have her voice well . while so ,
there honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential , but others who just have n't made any good songs all . for , whom last year was really a bit as the i a girl ,
when it has came down to the of john , he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time . what he had done with 's lyrics , he has ,
there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her ,
when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul , ,
there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is ,
if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but ,
there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs ,
when it has came down to , she has shown a really good voice and with her songs , but not all of them have been really . her song from her first album it kills ,
honestly , it is very tough whenever someone young and , dies at a young age , and in a stage in their life . sadly , it has been 20 years since the of michael ,
it is so and sad to know that it has nearly been 35 years since the world lost an amazing and artist . john showed so much success on his own , and when he a ,
when it has come down to recently , there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like lucky for jason . but for , his recent have been a bit weak heart ,
honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the ,
it is just so sad that it would 've been 's birthday . honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years , in ,
when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her ,
when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song ,
when it has came down to , musically she has n't really had the best in her songs that have driven home to her music . sadly , the lack of heart in her basic record ,
when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a ,
when it has honestly came down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant . sadly ,
when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart , and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer . unfortunately , happens to be ,
when it has came down t ballads from the 90 's , there were very few and far between that really had the brilliance , beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into . ,
when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with ,
for , she has shown a lot of strength in her acting in her shown on with and her as a part of . but for her singing , she definitely does n't seem to show ,
there is a real difference between being a singer and a , and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die , and you 're severely . has became the ,
it has felt like ages since has released anything new . the past several years , he had , and was dropped from his label after a set of songs . so it has been awhile ,
it has been a very long time since came out with a good song that . she had done well with tell me when she was a part of theory , and had a few songs ,
when it has came down to what , she has been more of a product , than a real singer . the surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date , ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
it is absolutely so sad that has been a poor role model in her music , and her own status as a , by not only making very poor choices with her own music , but ,
it is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs . has made some of the most songs that have came out the ,
when it has came down to in her songs , she just really does n't deliver anymore in regards to voice , and soul in regards to her songs each and every time . sadly , ,

when it has came down to girl groups , there are n't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within . musically , it has been much ,
there are sometimes moments where a can be a strong moment for the world , or a song that has lost all of the in the world . that unfortunately is the case with the of ,
it has been nearly 15 years since recorded their classic duet the boy is mine . yet , they are both dealing with a lot of lately , and that is the death of . yet ,
there is no question that when it has came down to real artists , john has made the most dynamic and contemporary songs of the past 45 years in music . that has not only been ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,

when it has came down to the past 25 years , has simply been the most dance of all time . her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . but , unfortunately her music ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since george michael and of made it big beyond their dreams and became household names in america . musically , has ended his music career , while ,

when it has came down to robin , this past year has been a real year with his music , and the smash success of lines . but his ballads have missed the mark with though ,
it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone who is that they have constantly thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those up singers who has been more like a in her ,
it has been a very long time since came out with something new . through it all , she has been through a lot of , with her ex husband on her , and trying to ,
things personally have n't been going 's way , musically and . with the not so surprising breakup of her and , many people have wondered if could bounce back from this . while she has ,

when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from ,
while has a lot of lately , especially with her latest album i am , she still has yet to turn a stone with ballads . while i was fairly happy with her single if i ,
it has been awhile since james came out with a intimate song . his last single , stay the night was , but a great pleasure song worth the listen to . his latest single definitely ,

while has had a lot of hits , there are a lot of songs that she has had on her own , and with 's child that have been less than a for your music collection ,
there are honestly some songs that sound even better after the original recording . but honestly , it takes a certain magic to absolutely it from the heart , and make it all worth the effort ,
if there is one thing i honestly love about , is that she has honestly been one of the very , very few singers that really has grown with her voice nicely , and showed more ,
there is so much that robin has gone through the past several years in regards to his own career . musically , he has tried to , after losing a massive from 's family in regards ,

when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,

when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has ,
there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made ,
has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her ,
when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album ,
there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice ,
when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart . ,
when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse , ,
it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it ,
when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she ,
it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs ,
there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to ,
there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

first , style , then shop , then shake , and now this pile of crap . seriously , this song sounds like a level picture book with an audio cd for to play duck duck ,
this song has the same problem as who says you ca n't go home by has . it is an already terrible song that on the radio way too much . who says you ca n't ,
i would 've definitely prepared the idea for to record this song on her own . when i first heard this song on the radio , i was totally dying for this song just to be ,
after a successful hit with it goes like this , makes an attempt at a second , and it may end up a hit . it is whether it will be bigger than his high single

dope album of the 2014 classic by ( dc , , ) group diamond . with production by hip 's this definitely allows you to enjoy the lyrics as much as the beats if you did ,
since there the trio of brown , red have been working tremendously putting out solos , ep 's and projects so when word that the latest offering became top 20 in hip charts it was , ,
great follow up to the 2013 self the features all contribute to the project and give extra , 's production is great with his sampling , mixing and vocal cuts playing within the beats allowing no ,
with his second album on def jam has definitely stepped up the sound not format wise but made it a lot more lush with other within his his songwriting ability is very well put together on ,
this is a very dope album , if you 've liked the last and or and with attitude album then you 'll surely dig this joint . production is very boom , lyrics are hardcore brilliance ,
the large professor produced project is grown man at its finest , check it out .

this review might be a little general . this is not one of 's best but its far from just decent . continues to give you rock and a couple songs that seem as though written ,
23 songs ! i gotta say it 's a classic . case and point there only three songs people might not immediately feel , but those three songs might be great to another . one thing ,
months after the release i have to say this cd ai n't as good to me now as it was then and 's cd n is better and so is t . i 's recent release

i thought it notable that was embarrassed by this movie , and he is the star . it is more of an eye candy flick , with enough and of playing , but other than that ,
this is one of those you do n't expect , and are n't quite sure what to make of it , and yet once you listen to it a couple times , it becomes one of ,
pantera ? nope ... . ? nope ... . ? nope ... . ? nope ... uncle slam . you get the picture . this album is fun , and the more invested you are in ,
the company band is like an ocd experiment . often brilliant , but not always . in this case , it works well as a rockin through a quick , four song jam . features prominently ,
i bought this mp3 on a , and am glad to have done so . some of these songs are pretty brilliant imo . my eyes in particular , a song about by and day from ,
the company band is like an ocd experiment . often brilliant , but not always . in this case , it works well as a rockin through a quick , four song jam . features prominently ,
this is a brilliant album . if you are familiar with these guys , then you know they are a , fake band that is just out there having a great time . what you may ,
this one took a few before i really appreciated it , but now , i absolutely love this album . at first , it sort of comes off like a band of sort of album , ,
there really is n't anything here worth buying . the song is pretty much just a boring waste of time . it is n't the worst song ever , but the music is pretty lame ,

i have bought a number of these low cost , 100 or so . this one is great . the sound of these tracks as mp3 's is excellent and the program content is excellent . ,
these are a great way to expose yourself to a broad range of works from great for essentially no money . ,
i have purchased many of these zero . 99 sets . these sets make great background music to play while working on my office computer . this set has problems . essentially , the recording is ,
great recordings . makes perfect study music . ,
like many of the other vox box offerings , this one is decades old . nevertheless , the quality of the sound is quite good . given that some of these pieces are not available elsewhere

at first , i was n't expecting much outside the usual style rock , although i did enjoy the first two of the . this has the song under the bridge for a late band member ,
song from a short lived band about being by the police . great use of keyboards and electronics . wonder what happened next ? too bad we 'll never find out . ,
this was the biggest hit from , 's famous musical trio of the 70 's , and dash . this was the one of a kind musical style that the these ladies wore . the horn ,
simply a good tune worth hearing time to time . ,
i purchased this song along with 's two album . all of it is in the style of rock , with more of a 70s hard rock sound with it . we could use more like ,
this music was before most all the music i came to enjoy , but the king of this era very much made some wonderful songs . i can understand why many became huge fans . is ,
words cannot express the musical brilliance of this song . the sound of mr . 's dealing with the in everyday life in his every . . much like what we all deal with and try ,
to many , this is the best single record ever to hit the radio and i agree . raw energy with perfectly matched about a girl 's lost dreams in the big time . no one ,

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,
there is something that i adore about , after she left the . she had honestly grown her voice , but also showed some really great songs over a career that still . she has definitely ,
there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,
there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions ,
there is honestly so much that i can say about the lack of in music today . there are some songs worth their effort , while there are others that could be better overall for their ,
there is no doubt about the lack of traditional r b soul that has been overlooked from radio the past few years . it has not only been sad , it shows that the music industry ,
there is no doubt that this past year has been a much harder year for artists to really deliver quality songs . for yo though , he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
when it has came down to , she has had a lot of good songs , yet so many people have n't given her the real and respect that have her voice well . while so ,
there honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential , but others who just have n't made any good songs all . for , whom last year was really a bit as the i a girl ,
when it has came down to the of john , he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time . what he had done with 's lyrics , he has ,
there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her ,
when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul , ,
there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is ,
if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but ,
there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs ,
when it has came down to , she has shown a really good voice and with her songs , but not all of them have been really . her song from her first album it kills ,
honestly , it is very tough whenever someone young and , dies at a young age , and in a stage in their life . sadly , it has been 20 years since the of michael ,
it is so and sad to know that it has nearly been 35 years since the world lost an amazing and artist . john showed so much success on his own , and when he a ,
when it has come down to recently , there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like lucky for jason . but for , his recent have been a bit weak heart ,
honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the ,
it is just so sad that it would 've been 's birthday . honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years , in ,
when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her ,
when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song ,
when it has came down to , musically she has n't really had the best in her songs that have driven home to her music . sadly , the lack of heart in her basic record ,
when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a ,
when it has honestly came down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant . sadly ,
when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart , and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer . unfortunately , happens to be ,
when it has came down t ballads from the 90 's , there were very few and far between that really had the brilliance , beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into . ,
when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with ,
for , she has shown a lot of strength in her acting in her shown on with and her as a part of . but for her singing , she definitely does n't seem to show ,
there is a real difference between being a singer and a , and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die , and you 're severely . has became the ,
it has felt like ages since has released anything new . the past several years , he had , and was dropped from his label after a set of songs . so it has been awhile ,
it has been a very long time since came out with a good song that . she had done well with tell me when she was a part of theory , and had a few songs ,
when it has came down to what , she has been more of a product , than a real singer . the surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date , ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
it is absolutely so sad that has been a poor role model in her music , and her own status as a , by not only making very poor choices with her own music , but ,
it is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs . has made some of the most songs that have came out the ,
when it has came down to in her songs , she just really does n't deliver anymore in regards to voice , and soul in regards to her songs each and every time . sadly , ,
there is no words to describe the news of today that had passed away at age 57 . with a set of in r b we 've lost this year with , white of earth , ,
when it has came down to girl groups , there are n't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within . musically , it has been much ,
there are sometimes moments where a can be a strong moment for the world , or a song that has lost all of the in the world . that unfortunately is the case with the of ,
it has been nearly 15 years since recorded their classic duet the boy is mine . yet , they are both dealing with a lot of lately , and that is the death of . yet ,
there is no question that when it has came down to real artists , john has made the most dynamic and contemporary songs of the past 45 years in music . that has not only been ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to in music , she has had some songs that have been good , while others have not been able to shine in music before like she and underneath your . ,
when it has came down to right now , there are very few pleasure songs that i love listening to from the 80 's . but honestly , one of the very few songs that surprised ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young and away , that we really have felt like we have enjoyed their music beyond a lifetime and the heart has shown it . white has ,
when it has came down to the past 25 years , has simply been the most dance of all time . her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . but , unfortunately her music ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since george michael and of made it big beyond their dreams and became household names in america . musically , has ended his music career , while ,
when it has came down to , she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing , but drive in good songs either ,
with a lack of really good music coming out the past year , there still have been some surprises that 've came out this year from acts that really been getting to the . for , ,
today would have been 's birthday . she sadly passed away three one two years ago , but the heart and soul of her beautiful and voice had never lost its , while she did lose ,
when it has came down to lo , he has had some ups and as a singer . on his own or with , he just has n't been able to hit more of a . ,
when it has came down to , she has n't been fully able to deliver with striking distance with her music . while she has been very close a few times with her music , not ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,

when it has came down to , and today 's , she has became the most product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs ,
when it has came down to pink 's recent release , , it has n't shown to be as strong as the feeling she had from some of her earlier songs . that also showed on ,
it is so hard to think of how sad and shallow it was for to drink her life away , after being and by her own fans after returning to the stage . nevertheless , her ,
there is no question that train has shown a strong return to the this past year as one of the of the past decade . while they just have n't had the sales that have shown ,

it is sad whenever someone young and does not even come close to delivering at the soul of the voice , and instead falling by the . for , she has been trying to into hood ,
there is no doubt that there are some artists who 've made some songs that have felt like flavor of the moment , and those who 've made songs that are just . that sadly is ,
it is honestly a moment , whenever somebody dies with a broken heart . when i had heard about the death of o , whom had the throughout the 90 's , i was shocked . ,
i could not believe the news of hearing that has died . i am deeply beyond what words can even express . her voice is always going to be a and beautiful gem . but when ,
when it comes to really good r b , there are very few that 've shown that heart like keys . after the success of her , songs in a minor , unplugged and of keys ,
when it has honestly came down to artists sampling other singers , there has to be a very classy and distinctive style to follow in suite . for anyone whom samples a john song , they ,
when it has came down to , and the music she has put out , she just does n't into what she had brought out when she ha started with i a girl a few years ,

if there honestly is shown about female singers of today like , and is that they have sincerely stopped coming from the heart . their songs have honestly made them feel more wasted than strong in ,
when it has came down to , musically she has lost her way in her music . after the performance at good morning america this week , many people are starting to wonder whether she really ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
when it has came down to , musically she has not been able to hit the nail on the head with voice and heart . her last album ca n't be tamed was absolutely awful . ,
when it has came down to what has been doing in music , it has been trying so hard to strip away from her image . she failed to it with her ca n't be tamed ,

it honestly is absolutely sad that whenever someone young and has all the talent in the world , can sincerely throw their career away . unfortunately , is one of those singers , who has became ,
when it has came down to pop music right now , it has definitely gone to be pretty lately for so many younger female acts . with songs from , and now with ha , there ,
when it has came down to what the family has tried to do with music , none of them have delivered as strongly as did with in songs and heart . for to follow what did ,
there is no question that there is a lack of really striking music out there . with , she has n't really grown into her music , and brought out a real feeling of strength where ,

there is no question about , and the she had to personally to as a single mom , and with the appeal of being as a artist . but , when it had came down to ,
i am not a huge fan of heavy metal , but honestly it is very surprising to take a spin of great covers . when i heard about , i was not really a huge fan ,
there is no question that chris brown has been through a lot in the . after being labeled as a girl beater from his with for a long while , he has really went through his ,
when it has really came down to jason , he actually has been making some songs that have absolutely delivered , not just in great melody , but keeps up showing why the best songs have ,

there is no question about my heart on the world losing . i have never felt so hurt in all of my life , but i am so glad that everyone is of how important and ,
for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time , ,
when it has came down to michael , he has made some really good songs that have been worth their while . not only that , but unlike so many other artists of today , he ,
there always has been something that has been said about michael jackson , past and present . musically , he had shown a lot of brilliance . but personally , michael was suffering internally and that ,

when it has came down to lady and her talent , she actually did n't deliver in regards to the music from her record . instead , the songs have been a big of that have ,
there is honestly a difference between a , and a singer who has really been to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore , because they are severely and . unfortunately , is ,
there honestly can be so much said about the music of the 80 's . there are some songs that are really beyond the soul of the heart , and others that may make you think ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
it has been a very long time since came out with new music . but nevertheless , he wanted his work in his songs to be his way , and not the way of what the ,
there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart ,
there is no question that today there has been a huge of good songs on the radio . more artists have chosen to do poor samples from distinctive songs , instead of just covering them . ,
when it has came down to new artists , they have to have the right notes and the right rhythm to make a song deliver . but when it does come down to make up and ,
when it has came down to , he has been one of the most distinctive that had ever came out in the 70 's . with he showed he was a amazing drummer , and stepped ,
when it has came to , she has had her own sound , her own class and a real and respect for soul r b music that back t the days of james brown , as ,
there is honestly a lot that i do love about sam smith . one thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul . ,
there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in ,
it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one ,
when it has came down to keys , ultimately she has been the best artist that has came out the past decade of music . she has had the and especially the style to match in ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has honestly came down to music lately , there have been a lot more artists than good ones , and good songs from great artists . but , there is always something waiting in ,
this past year so far , we 've have lost a lot of that really did know the strength of making great music with the of david and . but also , we 've seen a ,
when it has came down to , her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile . it has been a very long while since she came out with new songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and , really has thrown their own career away . for , she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real ,
hard to believe it has been two years since the world has lost an iconic legend , . but nevertheless , her voice will always past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson had delivered in music for the good and for the bad , he left a remarkable legacy in music that will never be , just like his ,
when it has came down to , she does n't even seem to with pop music . now , she is wasted her voice and ruined her heart in her songs . ball from her album ,
it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very ,
it is so sad whenever we have a artist become so , that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside . the truth about is that she is a product ,
there is no doubt about , as he has been one of the most universal and down to earth singer for the past four decades on his own and with the . but for his latest ,
, when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being ,
it has really became clear to me that has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade . not only for her own work , but she sadly has had some ,
honestly , the past few years for robin have been very hard for him and his personal life , with the end of his to , and losing big in regards to a with his song ,
when it does come down to john legend , he has been mostly known as the next , because of his ballads like heaven knows and his single ordinary people . but , he has n't ,
there is no question that michael jackson was a one of a kind . while he was popular , he died with a very broken heart , and with nothing to show for it , with ,
it is absolutely so sad that has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record , and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a whom has been ,
when it has came down to music this past year , there have really really been very few artists that have made the mark nicely in voice and heart with their songs , than cheap surprises ,
there is no doubt that it has been nearly a decade since jason broke through musically with his single , the . yet , he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the ,
there is so much that can be said about the legacy of john , and his songs from top to bottom . yet , it is so sad that it has been 35 years since john ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since keys came out of the music industry , and has shown that her work , her voice and her style have been both ,
there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's ,
there has been no doubt that there has been a lack from the talent from american this past year , not just on the show but with those who 've been past and . for , ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and leaves this earth so soon , and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music . that has ,
there is so much that i can say about female singer of today , they sincerely do not even come from the heart . with artists like , and others have sincerely sounded more like than ,
it has been a that has n't really brought out her a game into her songs recently . with following up to all i ever wanted , has had a strong gamble to make it worth ,
when it has came down to these days , it has been more about her personal life , than the of the music she wants to sing . it is very sad that she has not ,
when it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices . , whom back up for chris brown on his michael jackson hit she ai n't you , has a lot ,
when it has came down what had shown in music , she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry . but sadly , she has been ,
there is no question that has n't been in the best of shapes musically . while people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new for american this year ,
it is absolutely awful whenever someone has became more of a product than a strong singer . pulling a surprise record to the music industry , well has had a lot of wasted songs that has ,
hard to believe today it is five years since michael jackson lost his own life the way he did . i definitely do not think michael jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a ,
there is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days . but there are those few that have been one hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that . ,
when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england , ,
when it has came down to , she has n't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted . that appeal is written all in her album . ,
there is no question that has been so , that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has away . her music has been more like a fashion of time , but ,
there is no question that today 's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart , and lost its . for acts like jason , he has had a hard time ,
when it has came down to train , they definitely have made some excellent songs over the past several years , that have continued to shine with train 's musical status , of making the kind ,
when a new artist comes out with a song , she has to really drive into her first song . for who back on chris brown 's big hit she ai n't you , which worked ,
when it has came down to , he has had some great songs over the years , on his own and as a part f the brothers . but it has been awhile since mr . ,
last year has been a big year for . with her with the stars , and being a new addition for the sing off for , she has had a bit of . musically , she ,
there is so much that can be said for in her personal life right now . the end of her relationship with her future had ended with him on her , and also her music has ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson in his lifetime , he showed a great deal of good songs , but some of the times , he had songs he had recorded , have ,
when it has came down to movie songs for , lately they honestly just have not been able to in the way they used to back years ago , and all the way through to the ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more , than really soulful on radio . unfortunately , has been one of those that does deserve more credit because of her soul ,
when it has came down to pink , she has n't really hit that nail on the head with the songs yet . after her recent breakup from her , that still has n't yet stopped ,
the past several years have been very rough for . she had a gripe with her label , and said to sony . overall , she took a step further within her voice , and tried ,
it has nearly been a decade since we 've heard anything from . musically , they have been from the scene for a long time , while did well on his brief on american . but ,
it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and striking from . she had been from making music for quite a long time , not just on her own , but ,
when it has came down to movie songs lately , they have seemed to run out of the magic . unfortunately , i believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real , human and voice , and someone who themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person . unfortunately , is ,
when it has came down to , lately has been joy in the of for her and her husband . with a little one on the way , she has a lot to . still , ,
it is sad that when an artist has n't really brought out their best in their music . unfortunately for lady , her latest album has shown to be more of a of songs from the ,
it has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from robin . the past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life . from the ,
when it has came down to michael jackson , he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times . but honestly , it has nearly been seven years ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been ,
when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs ,
there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and ,
when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,
there is no question that like so many other r b acts for the past few years , has had the gamble to . after the past few new songs like every time the beat drops ,
hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the death of . musically , she was one of the most soulful r b in the world . yet , in the way was remembered ,
when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has ,
there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made ,
has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her ,
when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album ,
there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice ,
when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart . ,
when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse , ,
it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it ,
when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she ,
it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs ,
there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to ,
there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

mark is in fine form on this recording , which is full of songs crafted to be and tell a story you 'll want to hear told . lots of sounding ballads on this one . ,
wonderfully music , perfect for any need . i use it for background when i need to get creative at work , though i sometimes end up breaking off to listen hard . a of beautiful ,
caveat i am a huge james fan . please read accordingly . another extremely expensive from the star film , this one is actually two under one . the first disc has the original film score ,
i 'm on a of discovery , my collection and experience of prog from the classics of the first generation era i grew up with . and i found the somehow having heard not note one ,
it sounds , at first , as though were sitting in , but the results of that are very nice indeed in my opinion . this tracks sound like where floyd might have gone had they

do n't get me wrong , i am a big fan and i enjoyed legacy but its point was definitely the music and it is all captured here . the track the is iconic as much ,
quite frankly , i think has the best music of any show to be found on television , even beating out my for the quick songs in time , if anything , because of the consistency ,
this is one of my favorite from the birthday and that 's saying something because i think most of their are gold star worthy . the songs are and rich with the groups unique mix .

i love the song . however it never downloaded and therefore i have paid for nothing . i do n't like ripped off . there is nowhere to a complaint so i 'm doing it here ,
liked the lyrics . at times though the music seemed to drown out the singing . do n't think that was the intention . each time i hear it i like it a little more . ,
this is a song with lyrics that are so moving and express what many times is impossible to say . this version really uses the quality and tone of 's voice to full advantage . love ,
brings back so many wonderful memories . introduced this as a first of many to someone who has never heard of john .

wow what a difference from their last album again which was totally terrible and really bad vocals and song writing . is n't a total return to form for warrant but a heck of a lot ,
a little better than free but this album is still pretty weak overall . there are three or four great songs and then the rest if filler . boring ole filler . this is a typical ,
zipper skin is my biggest pleasure ever ! i can listen to it at anytime , well unless other people are around who just do n't understand the album . if you 're familiar with 70s

i just love everything about this song . the simple lyrics are and , with beautiful by . her rendering of like love changes everything and i was made to love you strongly hit the soul ,
as my with lady ( i never in a million years thought i 'd ever those words ) i find myself covered in as i discover these sessions here . so far i 've picked up ,
i 've already reviewed the three parts to this album , and so i 'm doing a little cut and paste action with this review . i was n't too surprised to see that this album ,
i had never heard of far east movement before hearing this club hit on the way home from work the other night and i was just . no , this song is not brilliant , but ,
unlike some of my fellow reviewers ( okay , one of them ) , i do n't think that this song or its message will end and separation . that said ; i absolutely love this ,
it seems that the is making a in the form of all these new acts that sound old . you can out in that . it 's interesting that they chose such a name for their ,
how to dress well reminds me of active child , very and and completely original in , which i really respond to . cold nights is edgy and with great pop that make it accessible despite ,
like a , connects to the pit of me with run away ; a soft yet piercing folk . with country , blue that sink deep into her musical , uses her stunning voice to create ,
has shot to fame quickly over the past few months thanks to her brilliantly crafted album back to black . a disc rich with eleven tracks all forth with and effortless , back to black is ,
since this album contains both animal and i just decided to post my reviews for both here . there is nothing special that comes from buying this version other than you save a buck or two ,
with and perfectly placed , really sets the bar pretty high with the energy not your fault . with a worthy chorus ( not to mention the during the ) , this is a track that ,
has , almost overnight , become pretty in the music industry . he 's like the male equivalent of . if you want a slick vocal to lace your chorus lines , you call ( just ,
i really like . i remember when i first heard and i was instantly hooked . i love their style and their sound and 's voice is magic to my ears . he has the perfect ,
i think i 'm in love with this song . it has just continued to grow and grow on me to the point where i consider it a marvelous folk to modern music . the content ,
with the beauty and mystery of a , gravity is the perfect for the vocal ability by bright ; both and each other flawlessly . the way these two vocal wonders play off one another ( ,
i really liked what i 've heard from , but i must admit to being put off by the grungy nature of holy holy , a song that does n't quite carry the same modern edge

perfectly crafted album by two artists who are absolutely at the top of their game . looking forward to seeing them live together in a couple months . ,
i read about on earlier today and decided to check her out . wow ! she 's got a voice like and songs like . she also has a little thrown in for good measure . ,
with his second full album continues to display his impressive songwriting skills and his voice just seems to get better . everything on here is worth listening to . you owe it to yourself to see

i like 's cover of this mitchell song better than 's even though has a better voice . i think it is the arrangement that makes it better . still it is a good one . ,
always liked this hit . song tells a story and i never of it . i recommend it to anyone looking for a great song . ,
one of those songs that up on you . soft rock by a great lead singer . simple , and smooth ... just pleasing to listen to ... recommend it ... ,
i believe this is the first song in the of johnny 's dark movie . when i heard it i flashed on my past . i never bought this years ago , but with the memories ,
this tune has been part of my memory since it came out . if there is anything wrong with it , it is that it is too short . a great song and a great memory ,
just about my favorite song by the ... ,
i always liked this song from the first day i heard it back in the day . i always wondered if did it first and this was a cover and how his version sounded . so ,
love this one . ,
always have . brings back a lot of good memories . recommend this to anyone who might love soft rock and not the kind that requires being ... ,
a work by a genius who died too young and could have given us a lot more . one that makes you realize that life can pass too fast and the roses are still there . ,
i always liked this song by blue eyes even though she sounds like she 's at times . great lyrics and a nice piece of music . ,

i like it . ,
always have . brings back a lot of good memories . recommend this to anyone who might love soft rock and not the kind that requires being ... ,
i listened to this song about 25 times right after i downloaded it . it has always been one of my favorite songs . i was of that when i heard it listening to am radio ,
this is a great album by a great band . had some great songs in this album . the walk of life is the best , but there are others worth a look . i bought ,
i like james taylor and this was his first big hit describing his time dealing with difficulties . and somewhat compared to later stuff like mexico and which sound more full and provide a real look ,
i think this is 's biggest hit . i guess she made quite a few songs based on double lyrics . seems a bit high school these , but if you like them here 's one ,
this song was the first song i ever saw on a music video back in the 70s ... was just beginning their run of hits ... still sounds just as great except now listening to it ,
one of the most beautiful songs john ever wrote . better every time i hear it . ca n't recommend it highly enough . a favorite of his first wife , he wrote it when they ,
great sound for a great series of movies . ,

hey ya 'll this band makes good ol music . . but lot 's of people rock it and i respect it . ,
it does n't matter what i have to say about the music , it could suck to you it could be really cool i do n't really care about this review crap when it comes to ,

this band makes cool sounds out of their instruments . but you can tell these guys are . they can use a little more brain power and discipline .

old school that 's showing its age but if you were in high school when it came out , it 'll probably still make you bob your head . ,
does n't quite match michael 's smooth voice but it 's not an unpleasant tune . ,
in my opinion , sounds better than the woman who the song in the movie but it 's still just not a great song . it 's very popular . ,
not one of 's best country songs but a solid transition into pop if that 's where he 's headed .

i have 1000 for anyone who can match half of these to a well known recent movie . yes , they are classics ... but the connection with movies is very . but okay classics . ,
this special was worth it . trouble falling ? this will help . but your friends wo n't rave about it . again , more obscure ( to me ) music to drown out the tv ,
yes , these are classics , and supposedly to love . but you have to know the whole context to really fall in love . again , a great bargain for sound in the background , ,
essential for a fan . recommended . ,
it was worth the zero price , so if you like piano , it 's a good investment . particularly if you like christmas ... this is for you .

if not i 'd at least tie it with my other two ( arguably three ) favorites of theirs that i 've never been able to put one above the other for very long . girls ,
the additional material is nice , but the is absolute trash . i never bothered to listen to this until this evening . other reviewers this version here are spot on . it 's near ruined ,
i 'm going to be very short and in the first week of hearing this album i had some pretty nasty things to say ( as many seem to ) but upon further it has grown ,
holy s t these sounds are good . this is a slow burn . this is a lit fuse . this will be into ages . there is a in here . this travels so many ,
what an unexpectedly awesome release from these guys . it has the , feel and that the weight is a gift had , but with serious even still . if you enjoyed their early 2000 's

the best by one of the best ! why this was not as big a hit as his later work or why he went all the way to 's just the way you are for another ,
yet another in a seemingly endless series of side projects and appearances , etc , etc . this one is outstanding in that it is a sound we do n't often her from and his band ,
listen carefully to the lyrics . they were about the anyone got in the 70 's . they may sound at first but listen carefully . it 's worth having more , but if you are ,
to me this is among 's greatest songs . yet it is left off of most . i had two other so i bought just this track to fill in a gap . but if you ,
to me this is among 's greatest songs . yet it is left off of most . i had two other so i bought just this track to fill in a gap . but if you ,
i first heard these guys on a link to a you tube video . the song was so good i had to check out the album . unlike many others , this group to care and ,
the best by one of the best ! why this was not as big a hit as his later work or why he went all the way to 's just the way you are for another ,
this was left out of the cd i have . it is a must have if you like the . so now i have it . ,
more time has been spent these lyrics than most any others . there has to be some kind of hidden somewhere in there . if you a child of the 70 's you know this song ,
no name choir , probably studio musicians . but they do a good job and the price is unbeatable . however , this does abuse the term must have . ,
with to . this is a great sad song from one of the most popular , most bands of the 70 's . definitely not classic rock , but soft rock as it was called at ,
perhaps one of the greatest soul songs of all time . it also had appeal . it has numerous times thanks to appearances and cover versions . this is the original ! there were a single ,
left off of many this song is one of my favorite songs . it was a fitting description of my who was killed in a car accident at a fairly young age not long ago . ,
's best . one of the great of the touched by an tv series . ,
personal favorite . huge hit in . maybe not so much in the us . but if you were around ago your very likely to recognize it . great song . has been covered by other ,
one of the better versions . it is probably the version you know . ,
the formula is simple ( minus silicone ) plus ( minus the park ) price ! lots of to texas swing , classic country and even a few to 60s pop . some of the songs ,
originally on the minor label release cold spring , this is to my taste at his very finest , maybe the best love song he wrote . unfortunately , had to from the lousy deal and ,
a massive collection at a great price ! but be warned the vox box series of classical was recorded in the 50 's and 60 's and some cuts in the series may date back even ,
listen carefully to the lyrics . they were about the anyone got in the 70 's . they may sound at first but listen carefully . it 's worth having more , but if you are ,
no problems downloading . be cautious there are versions by this artist that are covers made later in his career . i believe this is the original .

i recall this song when the first movie was ; i may not entirely get the idea , but i like the beat ; for me it seems to . ,
i first heard this song on tv . it that every one can have fun , no matter what they are doing . ,
when ever i listen to this song , i feel a rush of energy to get focused and get the job done . ,
i know this as the from ; i may have wanted this song , but i never knew the name of this song until i recently saw it on a music video . ,
personally , new style is a shock to me from the days , but when i listened to this song it felt like the inside of my heart . it feels like when i had a ,
i know this is song is possibly over a decade old , but i ca n't help but to feel the energy to fight when i hear it the beats . ,
i 've wanted this song since i heard it in a music video , but i could n't find it because i keep getting the name wrong ; i do n't know why this song was ,
i like the beat of the music ; the lyrics may be from the voices of trouble makers , but it still sounds fun . ,
i liked this song because it tells me that things can change in an instant if you meet the right person ; it could be a best friends , or that special someone . ,
this song speaks about the beauty of family and what if feels like to be with them or someone you love . in a way , life is beautiful ! ,
i first heard a version of this song by in a tv show ; when i heard it , i wanted it , but i was getting the title wrong . i never imagined it would ,
i had this song before , but it was n't compatible with my media player and i could n't play , so i had to buy it here . it 's been a while since i ,
i picked this song because i liked the sound of the beat . ,

the version is still good , but it 's more in tuned with the movie . this version explain the same message in real life you 're feeling that you gave up a life that was ,
i took me a while to properly listen to this song to learn its message . it talks about how you 'd feel when you lost or feel like you 've lost someone you care about ,
i did n't think about it at the time , but this song speaks about who people will when they fade away ; that they 'll never be gone . ,
the lyrics of this song tell you that you do n't have to do it all alone . i especially like the beat of the music ; it sounds like a tune for battle ! ,
since this song was based on a movie about a game , this song means that i can have fun no matter how old i get . ,
this song played at the end of the second movie ; when i listen to it , it sounds like asking for a second chance to erase mistakes . ,
i 've heard the lyrics from this song before , but i never knew it was from . when i heard a version of this song on a tv show , i became interested .

as most probably already know chris came from sound , but he formed . that distinctive voice could n't be mistaken when i heard on the sun it blew me away ... it deserves a listen ,
i give time of the a five star rating because it was the beginning of the 60 's movement . everything about the sound and the feeling of the music is magic ... i would recommend ,

it has a rhythm that sticks with you , even if it seems a little silly . ,
love it . much better than do n't ! ,
this has to be one of 's most fun songs ever ! ,
nice ! ,
as much as i have enjoyed the new movie i have to say that after listening to the music over and over it is like i am seeing the movie over and over in my head ,
amazing voice from one of the stars from girl meets world ! she already is the star ! ,
perfect to a perfect . ,
so glad i found this song again ! ca n't stop listening to it . ,
a different style for taylor no longer the little girl , now the more young lady with style ! ,
love the movie , love the music ! ,
has a golden voice . i can listen to her music over and over and i ca n't imagine i 'll ever get tired of it . and her songs are clean ! no , obnoxious ,
this young lady has a gorgeous voice ! enough said . ,
... sounds so much like ! the combination of her beautiful voice and the like voices of paul is a perfect one ! i can listen to this song forever . ,
love the song , love the melody ! excellent piece of work from these . i look forward to hearing more hits from them ! ,
has a beautiful voice ! nice use of an old folk song in the movie . be prepared , though , this song was recorded at a very low level and difficult to hear in the ,
this is truly taylor 's break out song ; so different from her other work ! ,
a very positive piece without being sounding . well worth it . ,
yes , , i will hold your hand ! her voice is gorgeous . her song is gold ! ,
these two voices blend together well , neither the other ! the song is a nice break from so much hip , hard rock , and just loud and obnoxious songs . this is my kinda ,
never fails to delight with her unique voice . this is one of her slower songs , which i like the best !

with the cover i was expecting the music to be faster . a lot of it was good music but with a on the front i was expecting faster beats or a more up tempo mix ,
listen to this song , i almost over looked it because it looked depressing , but it is a great workout song . ,
the music and vocals blend into a sound that you to listen to more of their . a sure winner for any library . ,
it picks up quickly and has an easy to listen to quality that makes the singers voice only sound better . ,
a little but a good song once it gets going , background could do with a little less noise , and a little more music . ,
he must have been in a when he wrote this , it needs more music , a better singer , and a point . ,
this song will move you to want to sing even if your not . she has a voice that makes you want to sing along . ,
the lead singer has a nice voice and the music nice while the words could have a little more content to them . it seems like a mix of pop and , so it 's fun ,
a cool song with a quick tempo , not a real dance song but you want to dance along with it . you really may like this song , it 's a little same threw out ,
this song is cool like ice and slower but with a beat that grabs you and makes you want to hear more . ,
the album is both fun and interesting and left me wanting to listen to it with out regret . i would suggest it to any one . ,
i was not sure if i liked it at first but soon found that it was maybe not my usual choice but a good one for me . ,
this artist was all too easy to listen to considering that she chose to go a little different from what i have heard before , i like it . ,
this mix of slow music is awesome for bed time or , it has a very diverse sound to it too that i like very much . ,
this song is great , fun melody , nice clean lyrics , and a fun style to it that pulls you in even if your not usually into blues . ,
the song is and easy to listen to but the words make you if there is a kid in the room , or a person . too bad , they could have had a hit with ,
i am not usually drawn to this kind of music but was happy with this album , some of the songs are a little or repeat things but for the most part , not a bad ,
this song is slow and very nice but i am sure that this is one of those songs that you would not want to listen to if you need to move quickly . but it has ,
i found this song to be up beat and from beginning to end . i would suggest it to any one , i would be surprised if this song does not show up more on the ,
if you like the black keys you will love this . i love the sound this band has created for themselves . this band is going to the top . you gotta try it . ,
this song has a cool personality that you will like even if your not really into modern music , the back ground music is cool and her voice is very . ,
while this album is a slower album it has a lot to offer and songs that have a melody and words with meaning that give the a reason to listen . ,
i was very disappointed with this artist , he has a great idea for a song and it up with the f word and acts like it adds some thing , when it does not . ,
this song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song . ,
i have some of there songs other then this and i like all of them , they have a fun beat and a cool back beat . ,
i was expecting a modern sound from the picture , but is coffee house jazz , with a sound so be warned . you might like it , i do , but it is jazz . ,
if you have ever listened to a song and tried to decide , do i like this or not ? this is one of those , i would not say that i do n't like it ,
i usually go for faster music but this mp3 album has a nice kind of mix and flavor you will enjoy . ,
i look for a little more umph in my music then this album has , if you like slow you will like this . ,
this song remind me of a lot of off the beaten path songs , wants to be one of a kind , and is . a mix of pop and coffee house music . ,
bravo , , this song does not fail to please , nice voice and feeling to every word . well done , a must have . ,
a good slow mood song , the sound of her voice is sweet and and even with the slow pace it makes you want to along . she has talent . ,
it reminds me of a slower heavy metal song by a hair band , and quickly becomes acid metal . then switches back . ,
the song is and easy to listen to but the words make you if there is a kid in the room , or a person . too bad , they could have had a hit with ,
the music is well picked but some of it sounds a little slow when put with other songs . it is a nice mix non the less and i am enjoying it very much . ,
i am not sure what the artist was doing here but wow . a little too odd for me . i am not sure what to say except that i did not like it . ,
this song has a very reggae pop feel to it , it has a fun sound and an interesting feel to it . reminds me of an 's song in some ways , very . ,
a good workout song , reminds me of a lot of workout songs with no words , keeps the beat fast and going . ,
this is such a fun song , you find yourself in your seat and wanting to jump up and dance around . and you will . ,
a lot of the same words and the music goes in circles , they could have done more with it to make it a lot better , i am not sure what , but having less ,
this song has a good feel to it even if the lead singer sounds a little , i could see this song going main the second some one finds it . ,
i was expecting to have at least a couple of fast songs , while some of it is much like bob 's slower works , it is a slow jam mp3 for sure . ,
good work out song and neat song on every level . i would recommend it to any one looking for a fun song . ,
it has a nice quality to it , but it is a little slow and drawn out , but it has a nice sound and is well put together to keep you listening without too much ,
this song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song . ,
i have listened to this a couple of times , it 's not too slow but not really fast either . could grow on a person , depends on what you are looking for . i ,
a fun song with a beat that is easy to listen to at any time and easy to add to a play list ,
it has a good message and melody , a little for any one not looking for that , but a fun song . ,
all i can say is what ? she has a great voice what was up with the music sounding like it is in the background , it takes a good song and makes it annoying . ,
i was not into it , you might be , but i was not . not in my library any more . i like some thing a little different then this . ,
it remind me of pop , meets , rock , meets new age , meets all in it 's own . a nice song for the buck ,
sounds like the background music for a horror film or a james film . i found it wanting on many levels . too bad , they could have so much more with it .

can i give an album more than five stars ? this deserves at least six ! i love the chance took in not making just another country album . i have only been all the way ,

i love the tracks by , and taylor . the others , not so much . all the songs are very good , i just do not care for the voices of the other two singers ,
this cd is great , and the only reason it is four not five stars is because most of this material is a from his first cd dog years which was a superior performance in my ,
right before i received 's newest album i had been telling my wife that i did n't think she could top how much i loved give up the ghost . i may have been wrong . ,
having never listened to taylor 's album i did not know what to expect other than the army of singles that had blasting out of every radio station for the past year . that being said

this singer was under appreciated for a long time , but this cd is almost perfect as works with old sound gamble to give us when i give my love ( this time ) , and ,
this collection is almost perfect , and with a band like , it 's hard to include everything , but this would 've made greatest hits a five star effort one . substitute the studio version ,
i finally decided to add the essential michael jackson three . zero set to my collection , and it 's almost perfect . unlike the original release , this one comes in a fold out case ,

this song is the best . however , they just could n't block out the sound . it 's not that i do n't like the song , it 's that it could use better blocking ,
if you are looking for a good song to download , you might as well x out of this and look for something else . seriously , they could 've been one of those electro pop ,
i love all the songs . this one is awesome like all the rest . but , even though i got the version , i could tell that q said the n word twice . i ,

every song on this ep album is great . they are each different in their own way . i 'm surprised three 16 is the least popular because that 's one of my favorites . but ,
i did n't like this song at first listen but it really grew on me . love it ! ,
i 've been a fan of for years now . i found out about her when i heard on the radio back in 2012 i believe . i thought her voice was so unique and powerful ,
with , tried giving us a completely different sound style , and i think it 's pretty , regardless of what the sales say , that not too many people are liking it . however , ,
giving this album two stars is being nice . not to mention her voice just gets so irritating after a while . f love , bounce , and work are good songs . black is okay ,
this song , in my opinion . if the chorus were to be completely different , this song would be a lot better . however , the entire song sounds nearly identical to problem . i ,
um ... ok i 'm not sorry , but this album is not that great . what are y all listening to ? ? i wanna listen to that album ! like damn no but seriously ,
i hope there is more coming because in my honest opinion , this is 's worst piece of work to date . it 's not a horrible album overall , but where are the hits ? ,
's are . this track is great . ca n't wait for her to release more new music !

very fun and song . ,
this is nothing but a contest . with the exception of maybe one or two selections , everything else sucks . he does n't sound like he 's worked on anything , does n't sound like ,
it 's fine fun even if the lyrics are a little . ,
this album sucks ! i could on about how great 's voice is , how and his are , the of finding love and still could not come up with a decent enough excuse for this

i thought it notable that was embarrassed by this movie , and he is the star . it is more of an eye candy flick , with enough and of playing , but other than that ,
this is one of those you do n't expect , and are n't quite sure what to make of it , and yet once you listen to it a couple times , it becomes one of ,
pantera ? nope ... . ? nope ... . ? nope ... . ? nope ... uncle slam . you get the picture . this album is fun , and the more invested you are in ,
the company band is like an ocd experiment . often brilliant , but not always . in this case , it works well as a rockin through a quick , four song jam . features prominently ,
i bought this mp3 on a , and am glad to have done so . some of these songs are pretty brilliant imo . my eyes in particular , a song about by and day from ,
the company band is like an ocd experiment . often brilliant , but not always . in this case , it works well as a rockin through a quick , four song jam . features prominently ,
this is a brilliant album . if you are familiar with these guys , then you know they are a , fake band that is just out there having a great time . what you may ,
this one took a few before i really appreciated it , but now , i absolutely love this album . at first , it sort of comes off like a band of sort of album , ,
there really is n't anything here worth buying . the song is pretty much just a boring waste of time . it is n't the worst song ever , but the music is pretty lame ,

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,
there is something that i adore about , after she left the . she had honestly grown her voice , but also showed some really great songs over a career that still . she has definitely ,
there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,
there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions ,
there is honestly so much that i can say about the lack of in music today . there are some songs worth their effort , while there are others that could be better overall for their ,
there is no doubt about the lack of traditional r b soul that has been overlooked from radio the past few years . it has not only been sad , it shows that the music industry ,
there is no doubt that this past year has been a much harder year for artists to really deliver quality songs . for yo though , he has shown a bit more promise with sensitivity and ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
when it has came down to , she has had a lot of good songs , yet so many people have n't given her the real and respect that have her voice well . while so ,
there honestly sometimes are artist who might have potential , but others who just have n't made any good songs all . for , whom last year was really a bit as the i a girl ,
when it has came down to the of john , he has had so many remarkable songs that have still stood the test of time . what he had done with 's lyrics , he has ,
there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her ,
when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul , ,
there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is ,
if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but ,
there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs ,
when it has came down to , she has shown a really good voice and with her songs , but not all of them have been really . her song from her first album it kills ,
honestly , it is very tough whenever someone young and , dies at a young age , and in a stage in their life . sadly , it has been 20 years since the of michael ,
it is so and sad to know that it has nearly been 35 years since the world lost an amazing and artist . john showed so much success on his own , and when he a ,
when it has come down to recently , there really have been only a few that actually shined on radio like lucky for jason . but for , his recent have been a bit weak heart ,
honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the ,
it is just so sad that it would 've been 's birthday . honestly words can still not express the beautiful and lovely treasure she had shared with the world for over 25 years , in ,
when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her ,
when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song ,
when it has came down to , musically she has n't really had the best in her songs that have driven home to her music . sadly , the lack of heart in her basic record ,
when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a ,
when it has honestly came down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , that has really been more annoying in her voice than brilliant . sadly ,
when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart , and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer . unfortunately , happens to be ,
when it has came down t ballads from the 90 's , there were very few and far between that really had the brilliance , beauty and simplicity to make songs written for them into . ,
when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with ,
for , she has shown a lot of strength in her acting in her shown on with and her as a part of . but for her singing , she definitely does n't seem to show ,
there is a real difference between being a singer and a , and being more like a manufactured product where your songs make your voice slowly die , and you 're severely . has became the ,
it has felt like ages since has released anything new . the past several years , he had , and was dropped from his label after a set of songs . so it has been awhile ,
it has been a very long time since came out with a good song that . she had done well with tell me when she was a part of theory , and had a few songs ,
when it has came down to what , she has been more of a product , than a real singer . the surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date , ,
for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some ,
it is absolutely so sad that has been a poor role model in her music , and her own status as a , by not only making very poor choices with her own music , but ,
it is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs . has made some of the most songs that have came out the ,
when it has came down to in her songs , she just really does n't deliver anymore in regards to voice , and soul in regards to her songs each and every time . sadly , ,
there is no words to describe the news of today that had passed away at age 57 . with a set of in r b we 've lost this year with , white of earth , ,
when it has came down to girl groups , there are n't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within . musically , it has been much ,
there are sometimes moments where a can be a strong moment for the world , or a song that has lost all of the in the world . that unfortunately is the case with the of ,
it has been nearly 15 years since recorded their classic duet the boy is mine . yet , they are both dealing with a lot of lately , and that is the death of . yet ,
there is no question that when it has came down to real artists , john has made the most dynamic and contemporary songs of the past 45 years in music . that has not only been ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to in music , she has had some songs that have been good , while others have not been able to shine in music before like she and underneath your . ,
when it has came down to right now , there are very few pleasure songs that i love listening to from the 80 's . but honestly , one of the very few songs that surprised ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young and away , that we really have felt like we have enjoyed their music beyond a lifetime and the heart has shown it . white has ,
when it has came down to the past 25 years , has simply been the most dance of all time . her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . but , unfortunately her music ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since george michael and of made it big beyond their dreams and became household names in america . musically , has ended his music career , while ,
when it has came down to , she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing , but drive in good songs either ,
with a lack of really good music coming out the past year , there still have been some surprises that 've came out this year from acts that really been getting to the . for , ,
today would have been 's birthday . she sadly passed away three one two years ago , but the heart and soul of her beautiful and voice had never lost its , while she did lose ,
when it has came down to lo , he has had some ups and as a singer . on his own or with , he just has n't been able to hit more of a . ,
when it has came down to , she has n't been fully able to deliver with striking distance with her music . while she has been very close a few times with her music , not ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had the songs to show that she can sing , yet enough know how to . the songs that she had out there , feel ,
when it has came down to robin , this past year has been a real year with his music , and the smash success of lines . but his ballads have missed the mark with though ,
it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone who is that they have constantly thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those up singers who has been more like a in her ,
it has been a very long time since came out with something new . through it all , she has been through a lot of , with her ex husband on her , and trying to ,
things personally have n't been going 's way , musically and . with the not so surprising breakup of her and , many people have wondered if could bounce back from this . while she has ,
it is so sad to know that it has been 10 years since , the lead vocalist of the lost his battle with cancer at 53 years old . while so many people have honestly turned ,
there are very few and far between male singers that today are really hitting the nail on the head with beautiful music . for sam smith , whom has been new to making music for the ,
if there is honestly one thing i adore about sam smith it is simply this , he can absolutely sing . his songs that he wrote for in the hour have been good , really good ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about a , it goes beyond what can be said . many of today 's female do not come from the heart , and they do not ,
there is no question that there is a of good music that was released in the past several years . but there really have been some surprises that were sure to knock you off your feet ,
it has been a rough past few years for . musically , she has had more hits outside of her own album , anti this past year . her work on songs like and this is ,
when it has came down to , and the hype around her music , it has been more of a than a strength in her voice . she has became so much of a product , ,
there honestly has been question about , and her album circus . while she has n't been able to score that wide appeal with all the problems she had gone through . while she has had ,
it has been a very , very long time since we 've heard anything new from keys . she has had a lot of good songs , but radio started to ignore her from her last ,
when it has came down to green day , musically they have a lot to prove in their songs since american idiot and century . sadly , i have n't heard it in the songs from ,
, when i hear , i have gotten to grow and into the rhythm of her songs , because of how rolling in the deep really hit the nail on the head . but some of ,
when it has came down to pink , she has brought out a into her edge of striking songs like the way she showed it with stupid girls back in , and get the party started ,
there are honestly times were a duet feels like it is a waste on the ears , heart and soul . that sadly has been the case with . her recent for ride have felt more ,
there is honestly no question that there sincerely has been a huge lag of female artists that could 've had more of the talent , if they actually delivered with better choices in song . that ,
there are very few artists that really did break out in the 2000 decade , whose music has meant to so many people , and is also it really means a lot more than just a ,
when it has came down to ed , he had made some of the best songs of the past several years when he came out with his plus album . songs like the a team and ,
there is no doubt about why i named the most artist of 2008 . she has had so many single and videos that have felt like they 've been flimsy and lacking a lot of heart ,
it has honestly been awhile since we 've heard anything from . there has been a lot of things that she went through musically , including a nasty with her ex label sony , and her ,
there honestly has not been that much music that really has captured from the soul from start to finish today . in fact , with most artists they have at the of the heart over and ,
when it has came down to , she has her music more in the gospel pop , rather than trying to stay as a into the pop world . she showed some songs well , but ,
when it has came down to and her music , she does n't seem to have the spark to match younger artists like taylor or with voice . has not made very good songs for the ,
when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from ,
while has a lot of lately , especially with her latest album i am , she still has yet to turn a stone with ballads . while i was fairly happy with her single if i ,
it has been awhile since james came out with a intimate song . his last single , stay the night was , but a great pleasure song worth the listen to . his latest single definitely ,
when it has came down to the around what lady had came out with her album , it has been more trash and than striking the heart of the music she has had within from her ,
when it has honestly came down to , he just has shown one of the voices in the music industry in a very long time . yet , he just has never been able to top ,
it is honestly very sad that whenever someone is , that they have thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those singers who has been so severely that the quality of her ,
it is absolutely sad that whenever someone who is young and takes on a different route in their work , where their career goes down to tubes . that is a very move at the start ,
hard to believe that it has nearly been a decade since the world lost one of the nicest soul singers , . yet , his body of work definitely belongs in the of the great soul ,
there is no doubt about jason this past year . he really showed that he can make more songs as a singer , rather than being someone who has been a novelty the past several years ,
when it has came down , they seem to have their ways with great music to a whole new generation . after the of , they have instead of making fresh and new music have decided ,
there is sincerely no question that was a one of a kind that really hit the nail on the head whether it was the , the work she had done for aids and cancer , or ,
when it has came down to , she has honestly been the most artist of the past decade . yet , when it has came down to her music , she has not really hit the ,
there is question that when it has came down to songwriting this past decade , keys has honestly been her own singer songwriter . not just brilliant at what she has done , but she never ,
as a of the new met fresh super center , i actually hear this song played a lot . for , , she really does n't seem to have the appeal to really rock out loud ,
it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very ,
there is no question that is a distinctive voice in gospel music that tall , yet he has had a few of the past few years . with the shocking death of his wife last year ,
when it honestly has came down to singers of today , they have sincerely lost their appeal from the heart . sadly , some artists have honestly have been so , the appeal of the songs ,
when it has came down to this past year for , she struggled from the of near fatal death after being placed in a , after a in regards to of her kids , to claiming ,
while has had a lot of hits , there are a lot of songs that she has had on her own , and with 's child that have been less than a for your music collection ,
there are honestly some songs that sound even better after the original recording . but honestly , it takes a certain magic to absolutely it from the heart , and make it all worth the effort ,
if there is one thing i honestly love about , is that she has honestly been one of the very , very few singers that really has grown with her voice nicely , and showed more ,
there is so much that robin has gone through the past several years in regards to his own career . musically , he has tried to , after losing a massive from 's family in regards ,
there honestly has n't been all that much when it has came down to real music that has spoken straight from the heart , especially in r b music . there has been so many poor ,

there is no question that michael jackson 's final album before he died , has had its moments from in the , from michael 's feelings of of , to poor reviews . nevertheless , there ,
when it has came down to the cast of , they have shown to be just wannabe singers , who 've made songs that are strong into weak little that were not meant to be broken ,
when it has came down to female artists from the , they have n't been striking in regards to music lately . of course , that showed examples from a few years ago from acts like ,

there is no question about my heart on the world losing . i have never felt so hurt in all of my life , but i am so glad that everyone is of how important and ,
for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time , ,
when it has came down to michael , he has made some really good songs that have been worth their while . not only that , but unlike so many other artists of today , he ,
there always has been something that has been said about michael jackson , past and present . musically , he had shown a lot of brilliance . but personally , michael was suffering internally and that ,
it has been awhile since has came out with a good song . her last album of an was an absolute and her last song was a absolutely song . her last time she had made ,
when it has came down to lady and her talent , she actually did n't deliver in regards to the music from her record . instead , the songs have been a big of that have ,
there is honestly a difference between a , and a singer who has really been to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore , because they are severely and . unfortunately , is ,
there honestly can be so much said about the music of the 80 's . there are some songs that are really beyond the soul of the heart , and others that may make you think ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with ,
it has been a very long time since came out with new music . but nevertheless , he wanted his work in his songs to be his way , and not the way of what the ,
there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart ,
there is no question that today there has been a huge of good songs on the radio . more artists have chosen to do poor samples from distinctive songs , instead of just covering them . ,
when it has came down to new artists , they have to have the right notes and the right rhythm to make a song deliver . but when it does come down to make up and ,
when it has came down to , he has been one of the most distinctive that had ever came out in the 70 's . with he showed he was a amazing drummer , and stepped ,
when it has came to , she has had her own sound , her own class and a real and respect for soul r b music that back t the days of james brown , as ,
there is honestly a lot that i do love about sam smith . one thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul . ,
there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in ,
it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one ,
when it has came down to keys , ultimately she has been the best artist that has came out the past decade of music . she has had the and especially the style to match in ,
hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when ,
when it has honestly came down to music lately , there have been a lot more artists than good ones , and good songs from great artists . but , there is always something waiting in ,
this past year so far , we 've have lost a lot of that really did know the strength of making great music with the of david and . but also , we 've seen a ,
when it has came down to , her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile . it has been a very long while since she came out with new songs ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and , really has thrown their own career away . for , she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real ,
hard to believe it has been two years since the world has lost an iconic legend , . but nevertheless , her voice will always past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most ,

when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson had delivered in music for the good and for the bad , he left a remarkable legacy in music that will never be , just like his ,
when it has came down to , she does n't even seem to with pop music . now , she is wasted her voice and ruined her heart in her songs . ball from her album ,
it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very ,
it is so sad whenever we have a artist become so , that they are more of a product than a real singer from the inside . the truth about is that she is a product ,
there is no doubt about , as he has been one of the most universal and down to earth singer for the past four decades on his own and with the . but for his latest ,
, when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being ,
it has really became clear to me that has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade . not only for her own work , but she sadly has had some ,
honestly , the past few years for robin have been very hard for him and his personal life , with the end of his to , and losing big in regards to a with his song ,
when it does come down to john legend , he has been mostly known as the next , because of his ballads like heaven knows and his single ordinary people . but , he has n't ,
there is no question that michael jackson was a one of a kind . while he was popular , he died with a very broken heart , and with nothing to show for it , with ,
it is absolutely so sad that has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record , and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a whom has been ,
when it has came down to music this past year , there have really really been very few artists that have made the mark nicely in voice and heart with their songs , than cheap surprises ,
there is no doubt that it has been nearly a decade since jason broke through musically with his single , the . yet , he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the ,
there is so much that can be said about the legacy of john , and his songs from top to bottom . yet , it is so sad that it has been 35 years since john ,
it is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since keys came out of the music industry , and has shown that her work , her voice and her style have been both ,
there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's ,
there has been no doubt that there has been a lack from the talent from american this past year , not just on the show but with those who 've been past and . for , ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and leaves this earth so soon , and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music . that has ,
there is so much that i can say about female singer of today , they sincerely do not even come from the heart . with artists like , and others have sincerely sounded more like than ,
it has been a that has n't really brought out her a game into her songs recently . with following up to all i ever wanted , has had a strong gamble to make it worth ,

when it has came down what had shown in music , she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry . but sadly , she has been ,
there is no question that has n't been in the best of shapes musically . while people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new for american this year ,
it is absolutely awful whenever someone has became more of a product than a strong singer . pulling a surprise record to the music industry , well has had a lot of wasted songs that has ,
hard to believe today it is five years since michael jackson lost his own life the way he did . i definitely do not think michael jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a ,
there is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days . but there are those few that have been one hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that . ,
when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england , ,
when it has came down to , she has n't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted . that appeal is written all in her album . ,
there is no question that has been so , that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has away . her music has been more like a fashion of time , but ,
there is no question that today 's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart , and lost its . for acts like jason , he has had a hard time ,
when it has came down to train , they definitely have made some excellent songs over the past several years , that have continued to shine with train 's musical status , of making the kind ,
when a new artist comes out with a song , she has to really drive into her first song . for who back on chris brown 's big hit she ai n't you , which worked ,

last year has been a big year for . with her with the stars , and being a new addition for the sing off for , she has had a bit of . musically , she ,
there is so much that can be said for in her personal life right now . the end of her relationship with her future had ended with him on her , and also her music has ,
when it has came down to what michael jackson in his lifetime , he showed a great deal of good songs , but some of the times , he had songs he had recorded , have ,
when it has came down to movie songs for , lately they honestly just have not been able to in the way they used to back years ago , and all the way through to the ,
the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click ,
hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is ,
it surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more , than really soulful on radio . unfortunately , has been one of those that does deserve more credit because of her soul ,
when it has came down to pink , she has n't really hit that nail on the head with the songs yet . after her recent breakup from her , that still has n't yet stopped ,
the past several years have been very rough for . she had a gripe with her label , and said to sony . overall , she took a step further within her voice , and tried ,
it has nearly been a decade since we 've heard anything from . musically , they have been from the scene for a long time , while did well on his brief on american . but ,
it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and striking from . she had been from making music for quite a long time , not just on her own , but ,
when it has came down to movie songs lately , they have seemed to run out of the magic . unfortunately , i believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs ,
hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real , human and voice , and someone who themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person . unfortunately , is ,
when it has came down to , lately has been joy in the of for her and her husband . with a little one on the way , she has a lot to . still , ,
it is sad that when an artist has n't really brought out their best in their music . unfortunately for lady , her latest album has shown to be more of a of songs from the ,
it has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from robin . the past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life . from the ,
when it has came down to michael jackson , he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times . but honestly , it has nearly been seven years ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been ,
when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs ,
there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and ,
when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company ,
there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many ,
there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just ,
there is no question that like so many other r b acts for the past few years , has had the gamble to . after the past few new songs like every time the beat drops ,
hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the death of . musically , she was one of the most soulful r b in the world . yet , in the way was remembered ,
when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has ,
there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made ,
has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her ,
when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album ,
there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice ,
when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart . ,
when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse , ,
it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it ,
when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she ,
it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs ,
there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to ,
there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

this is an excellent recording for just pleasant listening , very well done . there is really nothing more to say , as far as i am concerned . ,
it seems to say i did n't care for this cd as much as others of the same type that i have purchased . the price is certainly right , but the sound quality left much ,
excellent group with the vocals , i have enjoyed it two or three times a week for months now . the price was right too ! ,
i play this cd at night to go to sleep with , it 's and . i am so these songs appeal to me . i also recognize many of the singers voices throughout the recording ,
not one of my favorite groups . the is good , but the vocals lack the tight harmony of good blue . ,
this is a beautiful selection of piano music that i have listened to over and over , the price was exceptional , well worth the money . ,
the sound quality is excellent , songs are well done , the voices clean and with expression . it 's one of the most beautiful yet , i am so happy with it , i 've ,

has the sounds in the same mood setting as the ... that is in my opinion . however there are n't as many of his tunes in that mellow dramatic genre . ,
entertaining songs from an outstanding artist . ,
her voice has range and depth , brings a comfortable for a nice intimate dinner . not very intrusive , not necessarily either ...

it 's to see that a batch of late 70 's and early 80 's have been newly ( 2012 ) on cd by a label called ( big break records ) . is the first ,
the disappointment in realizing that way decided not to include , his first hot 100 hit and a double of and i love , is more than offset by the 38 funny tunes that are here ,
i love the , and there is no denying the of the tracks here . but does the world really need this after forty licks , jump back , hot rocks and more hot rocks ,

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i ,
do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the ,
keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line , ,
when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede ) ,
i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her . ,
as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 . ,
sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w . ,
i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's ,
this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format . ,
ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear ,
seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their . ,
i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me ,
yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my ,
great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out ) ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share ,
this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby ,
this s e like meets ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as . ,
although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and ,
head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the ,
it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the ,
more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these ,
the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole ,
i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart . ,
it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this ,
ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all ,
ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is ,
saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e . ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes ,
i have always been as far as liking petty 's music . yeah , i own the greatest hits album and yeah i think it 's pretty good . were there more acts that should 've ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
this song sounds like what the fat black cat that for would sound like if he did a song with the members of . this song is nothing special , sorta like a smooth silky up ,
does n't , the . chorus remind you of the people or sweaty men ? . .

other reviews detail the movie tie in , the ness of the song , etc . for me , i did not see the movie , but heard the song . after that , i could ,
when i first heard this song , i was a little let down . but as i got into the lyrics , i did feel better . the lyrics are pretty good and a bit more ,
yes the song has been out a while , ( 2012 ? ) . but the song still appears on the charts , still played at clubs , still on the radio . the year end ,
with the summer at an end , it 's time for the fall hit . this may be one . this is one of her to date , with an excellent hook and beat , and ,
glad to see her finally go a little . she is getting older and it is good to see such a successful effort . her voice is getting more , and this is an excellent production ,
first i like . i love . the song is good , has a good beat , very good to dance too . great groove . however . shop was clean compared to this . the ,
of all the songs , this may be the best . as always , 's voice just and shows depth and expression that makes this song plain exceptional and can stand on it 's own . ,
the song itself is a bit drive on the of we found love . a definite club song , well engineered for fm , it 's classic in this stage of her career with only girl ,
i have heard robin before . his sound me a bit of . then i heard this song . it 's almost summer , so some are due , the old songs of summer . when ,
imagine with an attitude , and this is it . did n't like it at first , but then it just grew on me . excellent club song , meant to be played load and the ,
i like lady ga ga , like her music , but frankly this song is not that good . it sounds like lets put something out that our fans will snap up at christmas and lets ,
overall this is a good album , not superb or great , but very good . the single is excellent , and the cd single is also recommended . being at the top of the dance ,
i have written other reviews of her , i love her music . i was waiting for her , the song that would break her free of just dance tracks ( which are fantastic ) and ,
saw this on good morning america this morning . i has always liked them and their music . listening to the mini concert ... they introduced this for the first time . they that this was

for the longest time i have tried to force myself to like steve vai 's , until one day i just said screw it and pretty much just the of ever really enjoying vai . so ,
they used to be so good and not even that long ago . in was excellent and gave me hope for a real decent future for the band . then the king of happened . a ,
go get effect , simple as that . i seriously do n't even know what i am listening to with this . ,
what happened to this band . diamond eyes was incredible beyond words . was pretty decent for the most part and now we have gore . the album should have been called meh , because that

the song is kind of to play out loud . ,
a classic from the . the singer passed away in 2009 but his songs always stuck around the internet for a while now . ,
the hook and the chorus brings out unique voice . the song is about police , issue . ,
taylor 's metal vocals and the heavy drumming add to the power and energy of the song . very heavy sounding but i do n't recommend it for younger who might be too young for this ,
an classic . value is always there . ,

a huge amount of music by the heavy ( , , etc ) along with others that are not as familiar . very good performances and sound . if you some this is for you . ,
it 's a mixed bag but the recordings alone make it worth having . most of the rest is good to very good . ,
one of my recordings from the vinyl days was playing two in a minor and a major . i had tried to get a cd version to no avail , but now i have it along ,
if you are interested in this music get a better recording . ,
the selection of is good , but the performances vary . the best is , as good as any i know . the new world and is pretty good but much of the rest is . ,
excellent , pleasant music , etc but is disappointing . still well worth it ,
lots of thought involved in the and yet sounds fresh . many are used , which may be authentic , but are somewhat distracting . still the best in my opinion , also interesting . ,
ordered but it never appeared in library of downloaded to my device . downloaded zip files but my kindle fire could not open them . no real support available . would like to comment on the

this song is all about the ! there are so many in today 's scene , but nothing is worse than the self 20 something female , who in modern times has a cell phone to ,
it 's srv , playing texas . do i really need to explain anything else ? ,
what can i say about these guys that has n't already been said ? they really hit a different level with this song , and they are showing there is still left to be made in ,
it 's likely the best song ever wrote , and it 's rather simple and . when you listen to it , you 'll probably wish like me that there was another in there , but ,
it 's the song that showed of his talent to the world , and it really never gets old either . mr . is such an understated , yet powerful . in a different life , ,
i do n't like country music . at all . but my does , and i have fun playing this one for her because sometimes we fight like dogs . and i definitely have heard worse

i like his guitar playing his versatility . but the songs themselves are pretty much there he reminds me of , , etc . . with the acoustic guitar . been there down that better in ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
is still the standard of because who else could make folks wait nearly two decades for said follow up ? now to me the will always be a standard period . and i still feel that ,
this cat has legit talent , however his material is about as as ex . i mean i have seen him on tv singing and playing drums , etc . . however his talent does n't ,
i have always enjoyed the fifth dimension . the re mastering sounds really good there voices sound strong . i heard alot of there cuts when i was a kid always remembered them . ,
de la soul a different era of hip and they were able to blend a of feel and yet be direct within a context and yet offer their own all at once . this album feels ,
i 've heard there stuff and its a cool of the sounding stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things , however they fall into a phrase called time music which works ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
always been a huge fan of the and michael jackson will always be the king of music to me and he left a mark unlike so few before or since . anyway lets get to the ,
its a cool album where some of the tracks he got some real and then its hit and miss . dig his flow and vibe and it works . in places and a cool set . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
i got this album when it first came out because i say you do . young love this album though on a whole had some moments interestingly has a more grown up vibe that alot of ,
you feel her soul and power on these . this is the real . hearing her doing gospel music is to the soul ears . a must have . ,
i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here . ,
broke r . still doing a broke take and no musical . now the cat can sing and has moments where his voice saves otherwise paint by the numbers material which leaves alot to be desired ,
kid rock is a frustrating act because just solely on the music front , he covers a few styles , problem is on an album like this he forgot the songs and settles for of what ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
straight up this cat has always had a nice voice and i his longevity from the to film , tv , etc . . cat has kept a brand going , however musically he has always ,
is a very artist to me . her voice is still something else it 's hard to believe she has been around as long as she has is only in her 40 's . she is ,
i guess if you use the formula and solo then throw a bone to and and have a 90 's vibe going on then it will make you appear as something more than the surface . ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
for as as she is and the fact she has a good sound and appeal her solo material tends to leave me rather cold . and while no doubt had good cuts and i feel they ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
its a standard album and at this point and time in her career she has stayed on course with a and its worked with where she is going and wanting to do . now her approach ,
paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very . ,
some of these tracks feel like they been sitting in a and while he has some moments , he does n't have that modern day money track that r . always brings to him . sounds ,
this was a good soulful and feel good project . i have much respect to because she was only getting better with time and she was n't as the industry is so age struck , she ,
hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation ,
one of those songs which is and easy and it feels good to the ears and it still moves the feet . the harmony and the groove is on point . very soulful and a strong ,
is arguably one of the most over hyped acts over the past decade easily . when she first arrived in her post pop era she seemed like something different . you know was a but in ,
the beach boys say summer with their music and also a time period and time . this collection takes you back to a different time and a this music is truly feel good and laid back ,
this cut still goes hard and i loved the harmony and vibe of this jam . very nine 's and yet direct and its a cool song to have a crisp fall day . ,
one of those artists that had the goods , however he never got the goods . like that pro who was top tier talent , however said person either never had the right , system or ,
rare earth were a good group . i just want to is a tight jam . their take on the get ready is cool . interestingly is their take on the j five 's hum along ,
on the for real , for real it seems like musically got musically after the late 80 's and lost what once made him a force back in the day . this song is boring and ,
is one of those where i keep expecting her to go full james and expect a classic song or , etc . instead of getting her doing 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from lightweight ,
is one of the best technical sounding and he always kept a groove and of course i the old triangle base he came out of with . problem is he is a third tier version of ,
somewhere between being a broke meets a broke and a couple of other acts in places . eye candy factor she is on point , as a music artist she is almost below zero . her ,
great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it . ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
john is a musician and overall artist , however this album feels like he went about making an album that takes away from his best strengths as a artist and feels like he settled for a ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
is still as sharp as all get up , however doing a duet with a broke in the album way down and the same goes when is singing with a broke r . in . needs ,
jackson get right all thru here . the words music have genius all over them . i have never heard a bad recording with these two great on it . very straight up at you . ,
he has some trip out jams just like the you gonna trip out on it from start to finish . i have had some of his hits for a few years if you can get into ,
really good balance of the past and present on this album . i 'm glad to see in his solo career and what an act two his solo career has been ? good combination and how ,
one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he ,
paul always keeps his own vibe and groove going and he is truly one of the best ever and the man stays in his and makes music stay steady with his presentation . this album finds ,
stone is one of the greatest musical ever and the bridges and path his sound and style set are still many decades and later and always will to me . and the family stone are one ,
is clearly one of the artists going today . as a songwriter , singer and musician not to mention as a live act he got his thing together . he came back with an album which ,
i like the concept but sounds just like anyone else be it or . alot of the material you can feel in the blank of where you heard it before . she still has time to ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
i have always and lady t . . no to , , etc . . however we did n't to leave these to have true blue eyed soul that stayed true to the root . never ,
this is one of george 's greatest . his playing vocals are incredible . this still shine . a must have . ,
first and foremost i always when black artists take back country music because country music is the baby of r b and gospel music . ray , and have showed you it can be done and ,
is to me . this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day . makes me think of 's closer meets 's white . is trying to channel so much , but ,
george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that ,
it was hit and miss in places . the best duet was with wonder and it worked . the rest are met with mixed results at best . good and production . the duet with john ,
the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she ,
they missed the boat by not having the better songs on the disc . the better cuts are all on the mp3 having said that the songs work better for the show as to their own ,
is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation ,
to me the hardest part of the entertainment industry is and having and making it all connect on the stage and with the pace of the music and this does that and more , its a ,
i have heard this album and i do n't get all the hype . is creative to a extent , but she sounds like trying to channel hill and it has a mixed reaction . the ,
i respect 's skills and the fact he is and , but musically when it comes to what he puts out on himself , there is alot to desired . the tracks feel like they are ,
nobody and i mean nobody is touching this soul brother when he can go from style to style and not miss a beat . i mean to radio message which echos part 's your love is ,
the brothers always seem to get right on the smooth jams . you know they are funky as all heck but they have made some of the most important ballads ever . this incredible family act ,
while knows what his sign is the month he was in , musically he is truly suffering from loss . somewhere between the early 80 's till early 90 's is where is in . while ,
michael jackson has always been period . from his days as a kid leading the to his incredible adult solo run . his vocal instrument alone has touched so many lives . his instrument of a ,
dig the police reggae influence and is the truth musically . he truly is versatile and multi and is going to be a force to be with for many years to come . and this song ,
a great on one of pop music 's most important artists ever . this is the first ever overall of his works as a solo artist and it does him musical justice . for the casual ,
the were the truth and nothing but the truth these songs still hold up really well and the and there versatility leads to that and more . in alot of ways you could n't put them ,
johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with ,
his music is incredible . i have listened to alot of his material . this set is a must have . his timing space is used really well here . leaves i wish i knew really ,
i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon ,
i 've never been that big on jewel sure did n't think she would ever try anything different so i was surprised when i heard her lead single off this set . she is still the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
sweet more than anybody else i have ever heard on a record or radio . his best jams to me were mainly on his set make it last forever . the thing is the cat had ,
i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend , ,
this is a pretty good . i feels good , stroke with a cool to of power the family stone . the blues is tight . it never rain in southern california is a classic slow ,
to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a ,
love has a top notch voice and one of those vocalist with the right material could and should have been bigger . this album of material does n't add anything and it does n't capture her ,
george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh . ,
its a cool record and right now mark is on the pulse of the music ear and him and alone got the song of the year . i mean funk alone is the jam jam right ,
oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so ,
he got over at a good time as a modern day broke meets a modern day broke michael jackson and it worked for a few projects and he made more of a name for himself as ,
at first i was checking to see what they might go as they have been pretty cool with their folk brand of pop music . however this album feels are for radio play . like they ,
now the dream got a ok pen game for others , however on his own , he just ai n't got alot going for him . as is the case with his previous other r . ,
rock funk all through this disc . the jams grooves never let up . the music non stop . the genius of is on full display here . more bounce to the ounce still makes heads ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,
i was curious about them after hearing there first couple of records and i did n't know they into jimmy ? i 'm hearing this album and it has polished production and some slick however the ,
this for me is miles last funky all out album . the grooves here work . him is something special . synth programming work . they are n't over the top like alot of 80 's ,
yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so ,
the blues is where ray got his center base took his along with adding other elements to his musical . his blend with his various over the years enhanced his vibe . night time is the ,

this is the of what 's wrong with film music today it 's , boring , and , while it fits the film is an bore to listen to isolated from the film . the score ,
sounds like was sampling some of 's score to the with some of this music in fact , i found this distracting enough while watching the film that i had to pause it to think of ,
fits the film nicely , but isolated it 's just a lot of percussion , strings and synth pounding noises . i do n't get the positive reviews , but i guess this just means anyone ,
some good , 80 's era synth pop material mostly including the well known people are people song . dave 's vocals are sharp and the synth spot on . ,
i realize what caused the at the it 's called an inferior band , in every way , tried to do a cover of a classic , and in the process and the original . this ,
this entire series is just fantastic . i was never a big fan of rod before and now i ca n't get enough of his great american series . his voice is just in these classics

there is so much that i have honestly loved about joe . musically , he was one of the but beautiful vocalists i have ever enjoyed listening to on radio . there will be never another ,
it has been a very long time since we have heard anything from don . the last time he made a solo album , was back in 2000 with inside job , and he just delivered ,
there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really ,
in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers , ,
when it has came down to , she has shown to feel from a lot of the that nearly cost her the deep drawn life that she hit . from a attempt , to of with ,
it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when ,
there is no question on why the music from mike and mike the mechanics still sounds so amazing . thirty years after they formed during the success of when he was with banks and , he ,
there is no question about why has n't really been able to shine in her songs lately . they all have felt exactly the same on top of each other . she has n't been able ,
when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after ,
there is honestly so much that can be said from a singer , who is a real singer . but , when they become more like a than a real singer , than you know it ,
there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and ,
there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony ,
when it has came down to what has offered in music , they have offered some really excellent songs like speed of sound , the and their hit yellow . now with coming out with a ,
it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far ,
there is no question about , and the way he has grown into his music with his last single . not afraid really set a strong tone for his record , and delivered very well . ,
when it has came down to what has tried to deliver after the smashing success of california , she has n't actually deliver her best as a , and instead delivered nothing more than a weak ,
when it has came down to robin , musically he seems to have it all , as a singer and a father . but surprisingly , he had a song that really did not appeal in ,
when it has came down to cover songs , nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with . for sweet , who did a brilliant of 's ,
when it has came down to , he had some great songs both behind the , and with his work on his own with this year so far , he hit a massive with the feel ,
there is no question of why has a lot to . musically , he has been the anniversary of face value being released , and had re his entire catalog from beginning to end . his ,
it has been a very long time since we have really anything driven from . musically , she has had a lot going wrong for her in her own , not only they have been very ,
there are sometimes songs that are worth being and that they are better later on . but in the case with covering a song today , it can be as bigger or smaller than when the ,
the past several years have been more about than any of the other . but also , it has been more about her in the music industry . but also it has been more about things ,
when it had came down to lady , she had so much in the way of noise with this way , and sadly she did n't actually for awhile , with hip surgery her tour , ,
there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs ,
when it honestly has came down to , she has had so many different singles from her album i am since it came out last year , actually six of them . unfortunately , after her ,
it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone who can have better talent , can really make terrible music . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has made some songs that really ,
when it has came down to and her worth in her music , its has been looked at being cheap , than strong in her own voice . whatever it took to the music her album ,
when it has came down to music this past year from female artists , it has in heart and voice , and left behind by and poor taste from artists like and . yet , they ,
there is something that i adore about , after she left the . she had honestly grown her voice , but also showed some really great songs over a career that still . she has definitely ,
there is so much you can absolutely say about weird . not only does he make funny songs , and excellent pop . but mostly all of the time , he delivers a song that can ,
when it has came down to , she just has n't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone . her music has gotten to be cheap , and not of tone from ,
these days with cover songs , unfortunately they are not even recognized at all . unfortunately , most of the covers in the past several years have been and not really as classy as the original ,
when it has came down to j . , musically she did n't strike the nail on the head with her last album . stronger with each tear did n't have the joy and the drive ,
when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled ,
it honestly does n't really seem to me on why there are a huge lack of strong songs coming out this past year , and with so many singers making really bad music that is worth ,
there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still ,
there is no question that today , music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers , joe who passed away at 70 years old . he honestly was one of the greatest singers of all ,
if there is honestly one thing that i do love about , is that out of all the female singers out there like or , is one of the very few that is n't severely , ,
it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of ,
there is honestly a difference between girl groups that can sincerely sing , and others that just sound silly after awhile , and not really as simply driven because of voice alone . there are n't ,
there honestly has strong lack of great songs out there right now . so , there have been a few that really have caught a strong eye lately , and lady has honestly been a huge ,
there is no question that when it has came down to artists , simply red has honestly been one of the most remarkable soul acts that had ever came out of the yet , it has ,
honestly , and i will say this , i am not a huge fan of music . but when it has came down to , he has honestly the longevity that most artists would honestly to ,
there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and ,
when it has came down to what has had to prove , away from what already in song and absolute heart , it has been a lot more than what has met the eye . her ,
when it has came down to allen , his surprising win on american , over the favorite of that time , was a huge surprise to anyone who had seen it coming . but honestly , ,
there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there ,
when it has came down to the songs from 's latest album , they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career . when i heard she even went back to the ,

there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed ,
to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i ,
do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the ,
keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line , ,
when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede ) ,
i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her . ,
as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 . ,
sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w . ,
i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's ,
this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format . ,
ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear ,
seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their . ,
i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me ,
yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my ,
great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out ) ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share ,
this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby ,
this s e like meets ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as . ,
although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and ,
head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the ,
it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the ,
more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these ,
the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole ,
i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart . ,
it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this ,
ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all ,
ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is ,
saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e . ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes ,
i have always been as far as liking petty 's music . yeah , i own the greatest hits album and yeah i think it 's pretty good . were there more acts that should 've ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
this song sounds like what the fat black cat that for would sound like if he did a song with the members of . this song is nothing special , sorta like a smooth silky up ,
does n't , the . chorus remind you of the people or sweaty men ? . .

jazzy hip with a great rhythm ! loves this jam ... ,
so good ! the drums and the beat ! ,
the other good song on this album ! ,

as oddly as it sounds , i think sam smith really makes this song what it is . without him in it , i do n't think i would enjoy it as much . his vocals ,
it was 99 cents . what can i say ? i bought it and i like about three or four songs on here . let 's talk is probably my favorite , which is odd because ,

i love this song ! it 's so classy and old school , without feeling like my 's music ( not that there 's anything wrong with her tunes ) . i like they way they ,

i heard this song on the radio and had to have it ! it 's so and up beat , and its easy to sing to as well . ,
this song always puts a smile on my face ! granted , i think it 's hard for anyone to sing a song about being happy , and then not be happy , but this song ,
anything touches is magic and is no exception . i like her song a lot better than the song with keys in the other james film . ,
sometimes i forget that is a adult , so this is a song that me of her actual age . it 's just a fun , we 're going song and i really enjoy it ! ,

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i ,
do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the ,
keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line , ,
when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede ) ,
i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her . ,
as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 . ,
sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w . ,
i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's ,
this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format . ,
ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear ,
seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their . ,
i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me ,
yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my ,
great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out ) ,
retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on ,
anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share ,
this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby ,
this s e like meets ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ... ,
tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as . ,
although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and ,
head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the ,
it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the ,
more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these ,
the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole ,
i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart . ,
it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this ,
ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all ,
ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is ,
saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e . ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ... ,
this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes ,
i have always been as far as liking petty 's music . yeah , i own the greatest hits album and yeah i think it 's pretty good . were there more acts that should 've ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
this song sounds like what the fat black cat that for would sound like if he did a song with the members of . this song is nothing special , sorta like a smooth silky up ,
does n't , the . chorus remind you of the people or sweaty men ? . .

i am fully aware that there are some out there who will give me some , even for an intermediate review on a classic album such as this one , but i really do have to ,
honestly , having been forced to hear this a number of times , my best friend and i thought it best to go somewhere where we were sure we we not going to hear it . ,
like with a handful of the i own in my now far larger cd collection , this album has been in my since i was about 14 , so needless to say , i should have ,
honestly , i should have done this review a while ago , but then again , considering the fact that i now have over 800 cds worth of music ( and counting ) , combined with ,
for one thing , i have to give credit for to try some songs without the use of on this album in contrast to animal . that might not be a bad thing , if she

here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol ,
many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it ,
i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations . ,
goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are ,
there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin ,
nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's ,
wow , this song is . i believe the were who take at 's . to add , to the of my ears when this plays on the radio , stations in south florida just keep ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
think of the best elements of 's funky alphabet street , rob base ez rock 's it takes two and u got it ! ,
da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ? ,
i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came ,
i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've ,
another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this . ,
one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been ,
this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me ,
if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country . ,
while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song ,
i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand ,
i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture ,
has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap ,
i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is ! ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio . ,
excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most ) ,
e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these ,
this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target ! ,
i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo , ,
i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do ,
this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich ,
this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me ! ,
the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording ! ,
i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am ,
ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person ,
wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad ,
and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ... ,
one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one ,
wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that ,
was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better ,
in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album . ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like . ,
excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops ) ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a , ,
is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me ,
this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played ,
for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael ,
another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or ,
i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set ,
the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape . ,
say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health ,
forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death . ,
people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ... ,
we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few ,
what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick ,
yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which ,
if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like ,
and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun ,
this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical ,
it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's ,
first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an ,
this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt ,
this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic ,
here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the ,
wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else ! ,
the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have ,
this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped ,
is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i ,
how lush and elegant . great voice ,
and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day ! ,
love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on ,
early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back ,
what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country ,
makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out ! ,
who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day ,
another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un ,
i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five ,
back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she ,
hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ... ,
i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan ,
i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ? ,
this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it ,
i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while ,
it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete ) ,
although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as ,
original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by ,
anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound ,
he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the ,
decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms ,
should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already . ,
when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin ,
i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two ,
the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so ,
kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio . ,
this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little ,
she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on ,
this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the ,
heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and ,
this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste ! ,
same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears ,
van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception ) ,
i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this ! ,
it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm ,
this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on ,
better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common . ,
i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on ,
and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la ,
do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him ,
this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play ,
this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like ,
but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's ,
when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound ,
