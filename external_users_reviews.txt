4952, 2, here 's a song about how much loves to get banged . just what people want their pre kids listening two on radio lol
4233, 4, many grew long after hearing this in 1990 . it was this song and groove is in the heart by lite that started the long . never understood the connection , but that 's how it
3117, 3, i grew long back when this song came out . i do n't know why ... they still play this a lot on those format stations .
7466, 3, goofy a country but strangely , it works . da pit puts da . strangely pit are
4358, 1, there you have it , an song that mimics the style of and , but worse because it 's a wanna be version of the artists , which were ok , but not great to begin
7894, 2, nothing too exciting here . sounds like a john ripoff song ... 's estate should him too like they did to robin ( i totally hear the melody of let 's get it on in 's

246, 4, da early ? songs were unique , specially round . also , loved 's version in young . who would name their act after a mexican ?
2796, 3, i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came
1482, 1, i 'd like to find a cd of this cover and on it ! ever heard 's superior version of the same song on vertical man w . vocals by ? ? uncle a should 've
6246, 1, another generic ass by not so dynamic duo of s . song bout in da club and just four . i 'd rather go pick the out of my dog 's than listen to this .
7672, 2, one of the only things getting played on radio these days in south florida that i can really appreciate is . is one of the top players in the game . 's in the song been
317, 1, this is boring a singer songwriter crap . how was she into rock n roll hall of ? ? this sounds like a ripoff song to me
7177, 1, if there was ever a song i grew to hate because these clueless fm radio program playing , it is this boring a tune . typically heard in and doctor 's around the country .
95, 3, while i of morning as country pop cheese , of ai n't a bad tune and i it in the early when they played the song on i 95 radio station from back in day in
2633, 1, this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like
2657, 1, tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song
2153, 3, i used to always hear this song playing in my head when i was out my . great ass lyrics i was the son of a man always spoke my mind with my in my hand
5496, 1, i think i 'd rather have some on my face if with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop . people apparently are exposed to this torture
3748, 1, has a voice that reminds me of balls covered in glass sliding down my . pure crap
4160, 1, i would rather go to my and eat one of my dog 's than listen to this garbage ! what a crappy , annoying song this is !
2413, 2, this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played
7041, 5, very cool tune . 's music is like a breath of fresh air all the generic pop garbage that of of the crap played on the radio .
7544, 4, excellent collection . love the version of on here ( possibly my favorite ) good drums rhythm space . rose , big river , me and my uncle . u will dig it the most )
3569, 1, e . king and and are probably rolling in their when they heard the of the classic stand by me by this music
1642, 3, anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound
475, 1, i back in da when i am just a girl from no doubt appeared on the . cool song . the sweet just stinks . i remember when college radio stations were playing no . these
4945, 1, this u2 ripoff band is really trying hard to get one of their songs played on a target . that 's all this crappy song is good for , a crappy target !
4476, 5, i believe that the funk brothers played on this . the playing is as is mr 's soulful growl . one of the greatest soul singers was david . this song rivals my girl imo ,
10770, 1, i simply do n't understand the hype . same tired formula seems to be applied to all ; 's recorded output . this stinks as bad as her solo work . all you have to do
5821, 1, this is the music you 'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber . the equivalent of eating a sandwich
373, 2, this is . hey , i dig a here and there but this is too much for me !
3911, 5, the singer sounds a bit like joe wit a little chris thrown in . love the guitar on this recording !
7086, 5, i am really digging these shows from late 69 and early 70 ! love their two drummer lineup with on vocals ! check out the hard to handle from the theatre show ( btw , the
1819, 2, this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little
6052, 2, this is n't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio . if it does n't grate my that much and does n't make me feel like i am
1134, 2, ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person
5195, 4, wow this takes me back . two this in grand am ... last heard it in a club in bout ... they pulled a . 22 on us there and kicked my car door ... bad
4466, 2, and it 's so friggin too ! ! time two pull out that again ! imo , this was the beginning of the end for , until ...
1123, 4, one of the best things sting did during his solo year . great music video on back in the day . the off of is also a great one
10619, 5, wow , cant b leave some dude is complaining bout mono on this mp3 version on amazon . git over it , knee grow ! btw , this is a cool ol . btw , that
1480, 5, was listed on the album sleeve under l . imo , this is cream 's best song and is as good as anything recorded by the beatles around the same time . clapton always worked better
10506, 4, in , could do no wrong , ! i highly recommend in the u.s. a album ( a lot of good songs ( this is one of the best tunes on that album .
2111, 3, it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's
2341, 1, if i was having myself a movement at a b joint in , usa and this came on mid movement , i 'd . it 's that terrible . this makes sound like .
7190, 5, excellent scarlett fire on the mountain . this has to be the best version or one of the best versions out there . love the track . on here is tops )
967, 5, the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape .
10449, 2, floats in and out of your , be it in an somewhere or some department store . kind of like a ,
7550, 1, is it just me or does this just sound like another type ripoff tune ? ? here at my job they have some crazy a radio station that keeps playing this ridiculous song . give me
2413, 2, this song is soooo played out ! it was n't all that to begin with ! but it only me more b c it is played
2939, 1, for ( she was like the max martin of the late early and wrote songs for a lot of chart pop crap . i mean , you to write song , you might as well michael
5823, 1, another generic top 40 crap song by . have you ever seen the movie ? it 's about the down of . the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units ( or
6159, 5, i have only heard only the bonus disc . it has n't left my cd player . nuff said ? ? bonus material ( from 10 21 ) big blues killer version of on this set
967, 5, the sound was created by building up multiple overdubs of the voices of stewart , , and singing a single note in . this multi track was then mixed and down onto 16 track tape .
8339, 1, say ... u ever in someone 's . that is the equivalent of listening to the new album . . this corporate crud is bad for your health
5227, 5, forget imagine it 's an and , played out song . i dig this tune alot better ! sadly , it was the last new music released by four years after his death .
5821, 1, people must have in their ears ( the ones giving this horrible song four and five stars ) all i hear is more crap ...
4591, 3, we were things and we were funny things , singing sweet home all summer long crazy a of 's sweet home and 's of . our boy from , had a big hit wit a few
6217, 1, what can i say other than this song sucks . sounds like everything else on the radio . but is n't that what does ? she 's a professional another top 40 in the music business
1236, 1, wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else !
5696, 1, horrible a song . i do n't know what 's more annoying 's crappy beats music , yo whining , or 's no talent a ... take your pick
10128, 2, yep , has been a has been for a long time . i give her kudos for being a old in a business sense and also her at staying relevant in the entertainment business , which
1143, 2, if you get an average song and play it and play it ad it becomes far more still . i can appreciate quite a few good sting police tunes . but overall , maybe just like
742, 2, and song by . to me their last great one was the permanent vacation album . pump , the album this came from was so so and this song has just been played to death and
3426, 1, hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ...
1156, 2, this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped
923, 1, this is actually a horrible of a much better song by them called walking in the sun
5183, 1, this song is generic garbage . plenty of people with horrible musical taste out there , judging by the five star reviews . i have heard least two or three songs out there that sound identical
2111, 3, it 's more smooth jazz style than his earlier stuff which was more straightforward jazz sound . features his famous cover version of 's
7721, 5, first of all john is a . he 's just it a one star review cos he 's pissed he did n't get a copy and it sold out lightning fast . the set has an
4638, 1, this song is pretty horrible . ripped off the ol dead or alive tune . this song is the equivalent of when you eat hot and then go have a movement that hurts yer butt
7817, 1, this is garbage . i cannot even tell if i 'm listening to , , or anymore . all this stuff sounds the same , and generic
5832, 2, here 's the deal ... the lyrics are good and the song ai n't bad ( check out youtube sensation 's stripped down version on youtube ) . what i hate is the production and arrangement
2849, 1, this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this
2110, 2, it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the
1236, 1, wow , talk about zero ! what do you do when you ca n't come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental what else !
7721, 5, the first set is typical . nice ( closer to . . album version than the version played show that same year aka dave 's picks one ) check out 's vocal on . i have
1156, 2, this song was an to all them cool ass white in the early 2000s ( in fact , it was played in the brothers classic movie white . i originally gave it one star but bumped
2355, 3, is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i
5686, 5, how lush and elegant . great voice
4088, 3, and this tune comes on when ( jason ) is in da club wit ( ) ... good times ... played out the cassette single back in the day !
6080, 4, love this early b . track . it 's really inspired . one of the tunes that the legend ( or , who 's side yer on ! ) was built on
3022, 2, early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back
1900, 1, what is this auto tuned crap ? ? this horrible song is me at work ! lol this sounds like the sounding song james taylor never wrote ... horrible , for the and easy listening country
8493, 1, makes me wanna start around the christmas tree ! ridiculously horrible , played out !
8378, 4, who do n't love ? i think it 's the only rock song i 've heard the use of . wore out my cassette copy of the high voltage album back in the day
5894, 2, another ass dance song for the mom crowd and the little crowd . the singer , brown , i am assuming she 's called , sounds like a low . in other words , an un
8440, 1, i think what makes it horrible is the radio ready slick production and arrangement . it apparently is to the who go out and download whatever song in popular on the radio within the last five
3964, 3, back in day ... i developed a signature dance to this song , the where you jiggle your body like if it was a getting bumped by those little bumper things inside a machine ... she
3426, 1, hearing this song is like the final few seconds before a huge attack . except it creates same effect on the ears . good looking girl though ...
1771, 4, i remember this when i was a kid and wanting to grow out my hair and just like england dan
7790, 3, i have to say i do find the song . the has taken the world of media by ... what 's next ... the ?
2849, 1, this song is horrible ! how is this so famous ? ? it 's a big corporate push a lot of money and financial , invested in her career . the suits who are pushing this
2340, 1, heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and
7483, 1, she just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio . she 's going for some dance oriented club friendly pop sound but there 's just nothing original about it
7770, 4, i 'd say that the original studio album is actually about three stars . the bonus cuts are a huge plus and boost the ratings significantly ( i have owned the original release for a while
6011, 1, it sounds like she is saying we found love in a place cannot believe garbage gets ( but then again , percent of what is getting mad is just complete )
10939, 4, although you can call white room practically a of this song . listen to the two songs back to back , the only difference is the vocal part . , it 's the same song as
7358, 2, original bout ! plus , anyone with musical taste knows it but i wonder about all the comments i see around saying song . she is just a good song ... the song was written by
1642, 3, anyone remember this a song ? anyway , it 's a direct ripoff of an song from the late called pump it up and it sounds a lot like a group that 's trying to sound
7637, 1, he popped all my buttons , and he ripped my he ed all on my very , lyrics . again , this type of music is to the lowest common . to the who to the
4381, 3, decided to make , along wit musical co , , those from da city , the ... some might say it 's a musical and . but hey , , love it on its own terms
4243, 1, should 've learned to leave well enough alone ! the is one of the most played out , songs we 're with on this so called classic rock radio format that is tired and already .
914, 1, when you call now all you hear is this awful song for twelve minutes straight ! i have nothing against rusted root but , this is a prime example of how a song can totally ruin
2030, 5, i have been a lot of g . d lately . this album has been on heavy rotation . best songs are wake up little , black , dark hollow , and . the last two
98, 1, the people who bought this song must 've had inside their ears . this song early 80 's fm cheese . do n't buy it ! it 'll make yer ears bleed . it 's so
6687, 3, kind of a slow down tempo . but this is the best thing by that 's being played on the radio .
1819, 2, this is a case of yet another , average song played out so bad by the horrible fm classic rock format stations that you end up it just a little
7420, 4, she 's easy on the eyes and the song is n't bad at all . kind of fun at the hip a little bit . much than 90 percent of the crap that 's played on
7317, 1, this is obnoxious , just like the rest of 's . she is so out of ideas ( not that she ever had any ) that she ripped off an old song , eye of the
2340, 1, heard it in some furniture store while furniture shopping . it sucks so bad that i felt compelled to write this review . i guess it 's perfect for a furniture store , generic , and
3334, 1, this is the most god awful piece of i have ever heard . how in was this song so popular ? ? i 'll tell ya how ... the general public has bad musical taste !
2723, 1, same tired formula repeated from baby one more time ( both crappy songs sound nearly identical ) seriously doubt she had anything to do with writing or producing this for the ears
11108, 2, van halen really out w . this song . do n't let this mushy pop you from sampling the album ( as a whole , this album rocks plenty this weak song being the exception )
6961, 4, i immediately recognized 's got to give up and the michael jackson ! sample . i do n't hear much on the radio these days that i really dig , but , i like this !
4667, 2, it so played out on these so called classic rock format fm stations . another song that needs to be from all fm . i 've been to the bob era live recording from . fm
1816, 5, this is one of the songs recorded in the by anyone ... period ! i do n't have the whole album of the same name which this song comes from but to obtain it is on
10009, 1, better lyrics might from a individual 's mind but hey stuff is mass produced cutter designed to the lowest common .
7013, 4, i 've been listening to some bluegrass lately so this free bluegrass my interest . not dissappointed at all ( ca n't go wrong if it 's free ! ) unlike many free , downloaded on
6684, 5, and should do a whole album of tunes together . the on here remind me of old before they puss e 'd out in the there 's also some sick distorted guitar in there a la
8690, 2, do we really need some more of this corporate ? i mean really , i ca n't even tell if is black , white , or ( what is he ? ) i have heard him
3824, 2, this is lame a by a dude who thinks he 's cool enough to jam with bob . he 's a , corporate playing . the proof is in this lame o tune made to play
2633, 1, this is an piece of . just cos u can sing real good do n't mean u do n't have to b original . still accounts for a lot u just like when u release like
6728, 3, but it still does n't earn ya a five star ride from , ! he does have songwriting skills above the average group flavor of the month on the radio . you can tell he 's
3477, 4, when this song was popular . i wanted to grow my hair and it to look just like z and doctor from the ( and then go play with lol ) a lot of these sound
1886, 2, why were they so many late early sixties covers during this period ? and how come these cover versions so high ? this cover of an early sixties tune of i am so out that i
10309, 1, do n't get me wrong . i love and his beatles inspired like do ya , living thing , line and from the first album no answer . but this is a horrible , inspired by
2110, 2, it 's terrible when fm radio plays out a song that was average to begin with . it makes it even more to the
2239, 1, i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ...
3048, 3, wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ...
10315, 3, this song always reminds me of that a movie with and called , the flick that they play cops with . you know , they play this song in the scene where character is on the
6467, 5, keep in mind , i am not a huge fan of without a net . this from the 1990 summer tour is awesome , samson , west la , beat it on down the line ,
3260, 2, when i first heard this i thought it was . take that was one of the worst bands by the 90s movement ( , oasis , suede )
4092, 1, i do n't hate all of 's work but this song is lame as heck . rather go with another song by her .
5290, 5, as a young kid , i was a collector of non beatle apple records releases . this collection does a good job of various singles released on apple in the period between 1968 and 1973 .
561, 3, sounds a lot more like country than a lot of the new country pop crap . turner has a good voice too reminds me a bit of junior brown crossed w .
8143, 5, i listened to disc three on the way two work . is a ! . some of the best live dead ever recorded ! . uncle john 's band is excellent as well . there 's
2356, 1, this song is boring , , and as generic as you can get . just crap made to to boring a fm radio easy listening for doctor 's format .
8715, 3, ha ha ! love the weird ice cream truck music put on this track ! well , no , it sounds like music you would hear at a party ( believe me , i can hear
7339, 1, seriously ? what is this crap ? people who seriously consider this music need to have their brain for on their .
5358, 2, i am giving it two stars because it is n't the absolute worst that gets played on the radio here in south florida . it seems like there 's an in the song that remind me
384, 2, yeah , daddy 's girls could sing but the late early sterile the track significantly . although they had a hit with it , it has n't aged well , like a lot of the music
2782, 4, retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on
3015, 1, this is not only a horrible song . it is quite possible the worst song ever recorded and released since the of recorded music . what a piece of ! i have about different on my
3560, 5, great little tune . one that i actually got to hear on plain old station on fm radio ( usually they play played out )
2782, 4, retro style soul u should here ( if u have n't already ) when that old soul vibe gets by a young up and coming like ms . keys , the results are magical as on
5696, 1, anybody who put their name on this piece of should be from ever recording music again . the three a who did this song , , and have little or no talent . the 's share
2148, 4, this song was hot in the early ... boom boom down , baby
7874, 2, this s e like meets
1134, 2, ever wonder what sting is singing about at the end of the song ? ( pi , pi , pi ) the spanish of the word is or may refer to a pain , a person
3022, 2, early pop cheese has n't well b c the and the production sounds like that , cold sounding late early sound that has n't too well . was looking fine in the video though , back
2239, 1, i do n't get how people consider this to be such a great cover of 's song . she and it 's just kind of an annoying song to sit through ... what a drag ...
6114, 4, tune . reminds me a little of the song to . this song has my interest to this new artist known as .
5711, 4, although imo , 's first three self , , and the number of the beast were my favorites but somewhere in time has alot of great songs like , the great , wasted years , and
677, 4, head played in . this song is one of those that i could n't wait to hear played on the radio when i was a kid . flashback two there i was , waiting with the
8624, 2, it 's so sad that these two artists are lacking so much talent that they to recording that makes the two live crew sound like a . butter is when you pull you out of the
5700, 2, more cutter fm radio friendly adult oriented alternative ? ? i am not saying these guys are n't proficient musicians , nor that they are bottom of the musical pile . i am simply that these
209, 3, the production is a little but it brings back a lot of good memories from back in the days . around town with my white vice style jacket in my monte that had a rust hole
4618, 3, i like the stripped down piano and vocal arrangement . a little bit
2657, 1, tell me , what doctor 's office or has n't been playing this constantly . as if we were n't enough with it in the . why oh why ? wo n't this song , song
7662, 3, with so much , shallow , garbage that contemporary music , it 's nice to hear a positive message in a song . love the phrase write your story on my heart .
7139, 5, it 's da coolest song bout being happy since do n't worry be happy came out in 88 . it 's really annoying when some song comes out and it sounds like everything else . this
6556, 5, ah ! shopping the store ! i gotta hand it to em , the topic of has never been in song . how many more songs do we have to hear about love , and all
8396, 2, ha ha definitely this song fits the song genre perfectly . lyrics are kinda in line with two live crew 's me so knee or 's my ding a ( i love though , this is
8478, 4, saw her on 's see e and , boy , am i impressed . one of a kind singer in a world of cutter s e .
2355, 3, is it just me or does this seem almost like a song that is the vibe of santana 's black magic woman ? when i was a kid and did n't know who was , i
7638, 2, the vocals are pretty as are the lyrics . ca n't understand this . i like the drum and bass type arrangement z 's is ok
2796, 3, i am old enough to remember when this song came out and was being played constantly on the radio . you know it 's cheese if i confused it for air supply when it first came
3048, 3, wow , this song gives me a to that called the early to mid ... that journey at and out on our bill and w . the purple in ... good times ...
1586, 1, this crappy song is n't even worthy of getting played in those dumb a target that try to be hip by playing some tunes

9155, 2, there is honestly a lack from female singers of today . they sincerely have not made songs that drove from the soul of the heart , and instead have had a lot of songs that really
8607, 5, in so many ways , there really are n't a lot of beautiful singers that sincerely come from the heart . female singers have became more like they are products than people . for singers ,

798, 4, there is no question that when it has came down to brilliant music , john has been the one constant that so many really do wish they had in music . hard to believe he and
9234, 4, there are just too few songs really that have delivered the past few years , because there has been a lag on what great music really is . instead , so many artists like fifth harmony

5082, 4, when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled

8627, 2, when it has came down to and west , their songs have honestly been more than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul ,
7578, 1, there are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort . but often , when it is done for , it can be a bigger bomb . the biggest exception where it is
11780, 5, if there is one thing that i have always loved about , is that when it has came down to his solo songs , they have been very strong , and from the soul . but

9470, 2, honestly , i have not really been intrigued by girl groups for the past decade , because they have not had the strike in the of the iron , while the songs were hot from the

11358, 3, when it has came down to , she has truly made a deep and strong impact into american this past year with , and her songs like love and i will be . but for her
5131, 2, when it has came down to , he definitely has shown a strike of better on his own with his last single from , not afraid . unfortunately , when there is always a great song

7633, 3, when it as came down to , sadly the quality of her voice has absolutely died , and she sold her own worth in heart away . there is a deep difference being between being a

5928, 4, when it has came considered down to michael , he has actually been one of the few singers that actually has made standards his own , without the feeling that they are either or down like

3081, 3, for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some
9423, 2, it is absolutely so sad that has been a poor role model in her music , and her own status as a , by not only making very poor choices with her own music , but
8829, 1, it is absolutely so sincerely sad that someone young and has really wasted their voice and their talent away in poorly made songs . has made some of the most songs that have came out the
7744, 2, when it has came down to in her songs , she just really does n't deliver anymore in regards to voice , and soul in regards to her songs each and every time . sadly ,
1527, 4, there is no words to describe the news of today that had passed away at age 57 . with a set of in r b we 've lost this year with , white of earth ,
9471, 3, when it has came down to girl groups , there are n't really a whole lot of them that have lately delivered from the soul of the voice within . musically , it has been much
5049, 3, there are sometimes moments where a can be a strong moment for the world , or a song that has lost all of the in the world . that unfortunately is the case with the of
6158, 3, it has been nearly 15 years since recorded their classic duet the boy is mine . yet , they are both dealing with a lot of lately , and that is the death of . yet
11101, 4, there is no question that when it has came down to real artists , john has made the most dynamic and contemporary songs of the past 45 years in music . that has not only been
2512, 4, there is honestly so much that can be said about anyone , whom can try and sing the star . it has been done so many times , and by so many people , but there
7772, 3, when it has came down to in music , she has had some songs that have been good , while others have not been able to shine in music before like she and underneath your .
5229, 5, when it has came down to right now , there are very few pleasure songs that i love listening to from the 80 's . but honestly , one of the very few songs that surprised
2532, 4, there is no question about how michael jackson had to follow up his monster album with his bad record ; while bad was n't as strong as in sales , it did have some great songs
2467, 4, it is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone young and away , that we really have felt like we have enjoyed their music beyond a lifetime and the heart has shown it . white has
6113, 2, when it has came down to the past 25 years , has simply been the most dance of all time . her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary . but , unfortunately her music
2657, 5, hard to believe that it has been 30 years since george michael and of made it big beyond their dreams and became household names in america . musically , has ended his music career , while
9389, 2, when it has came down to , she has really came out with some very awful songs that show that she not only does not know how to sing , but drive in good songs either
5271, 4, with a lack of really good music coming out the past year , there still have been some surprises that 've came out this year from acts that really been getting to the . for ,
8606, 5, today would have been 's birthday . she sadly passed away three one two years ago , but the heart and soul of her beautiful and voice had never lost its , while she did lose
5327, 4, when it has came down to lo , he has had some ups and as a singer . on his own or with , he just has n't been able to hit more of a .
5088, 3, when it has came down to , she has n't been fully able to deliver with striking distance with her music . while she has been very close a few times with her music , not
1165, 3, the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click
5392, 2, when it has came down to , she just has n't had the songs to show that she can sing , yet enough know how to . the songs that she had out there , feel
7253, 3, when it has came down to robin , this past year has been a real year with his music , and the smash success of lines . but his ballads have missed the mark with though
8829, 1, it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone who is that they have constantly thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those up singers who has been more like a in her
5667, 3, it has been a very long time since came out with something new . through it all , she has been through a lot of , with her ex husband on her , and trying to
5607, 2, things personally have n't been going 's way , musically and . with the not so surprising breakup of her and , many people have wondered if could bounce back from this . while she has
3321, 4, it is so sad to know that it has been 10 years since , the lead vocalist of the lost his battle with cancer at 53 years old . while so many people have honestly turned
8039, 4, there are very few and far between male singers that today are really hitting the nail on the head with beautiful music . for sam smith , whom has been new to making music for the
8037, 4, if there is honestly one thing i adore about sam smith it is simply this , he can absolutely sing . his songs that he wrote for in the hour have been good , really good
2445, 4, there is honestly so much that can be said about a , it goes beyond what can be said . many of today 's female do not come from the heart , and they do not
5645, 4, there is no question that there is a of good music that was released in the past several years . but there really have been some surprises that were sure to knock you off your feet
9424, 3, it has been a rough past few years for . musically , she has had more hits outside of her own album , anti this past year . her work on songs like and this is
7639, 2, when it has came down to , and the hype around her music , it has been more of a than a strength in her voice . she has became so much of a product ,
10907, 1, there honestly has been question about , and her album circus . while she has n't been able to score that wide appeal with all the problems she had gone through . while she has had
9598, 4, it has been a very , very long time since we 've heard anything new from keys . she has had a lot of good songs , but radio started to ignore her from her last
6522, 3, when it has came down to green day , musically they have a lot to prove in their songs since american idiot and century . sadly , i have n't heard it in the songs from
5511, 4, , when i hear , i have gotten to grow and into the rhythm of her songs , because of how rolling in the deep really hit the nail on the head . but some of
5368, 3, when it has came down to pink , she has brought out a into her edge of striking songs like the way she showed it with stupid girls back in , and get the party started
4645, 2, there are honestly times were a duet feels like it is a waste on the ears , heart and soul . that sadly has been the case with . her recent for ride have felt more
9471, 3, there is honestly no question that there sincerely has been a huge lag of female artists that could 've had more of the talent , if they actually delivered with better choices in song . that
7998, 5, there are very few artists that really did break out in the 2000 decade , whose music has meant to so many people , and is also it really means a lot more than just a
7881, 3, when it has came down to ed , he had made some of the best songs of the past several years when he came out with his plus album . songs like the a team and
3773, 1, there is no doubt about why i named the most artist of 2008 . she has had so many single and videos that have felt like they 've been flimsy and lacking a lot of heart
5619, 3, it has honestly been awhile since we 've heard anything from . there has been a lot of things that she went through musically , including a nasty with her ex label sony , and her
7893, 4, there honestly has not been that much music that really has captured from the soul from start to finish today . in fact , with most artists they have at the of the heart over and
8009, 3, when it has came down to , she has her music more in the gospel pop , rather than trying to stay as a into the pop world . she showed some songs well , but
7201, 2, when it has came down to and her music , she does n't seem to have the spark to match younger artists like taylor or with voice . has not made very good songs for the
2902, 4, when it has came down american , there are very few and far between that have really made a great impression with a good song . has been no with her big hit before he from
4223, 4, while has a lot of lately , especially with her latest album i am , she still has yet to turn a stone with ballads . while i was fairly happy with her single if i
7278, 4, it has been awhile since james came out with a intimate song . his last single , stay the night was , but a great pleasure song worth the listen to . his latest single definitely
11580, 2, when it has came down to the around what lady had came out with her album , it has been more trash and than striking the heart of the music she has had within from her
1508, 4, when it has honestly came down to , he just has shown one of the voices in the music industry in a very long time . yet , he just has never been able to top
8828, 1, it is honestly very sad that whenever someone is , that they have thrown their voice away . unfortunately , has been one of those singers who has been so severely that the quality of her
9482, 2, it is absolutely sad that whenever someone who is young and takes on a different route in their work , where their career goes down to tubes . that is a very move at the start
5194, 4, hard to believe that it has nearly been a decade since the world lost one of the nicest soul singers , . yet , his body of work definitely belongs in the of the great soul
3713, 3, there is no doubt about jason this past year . he really showed that he can make more songs as a singer , rather than being someone who has been a novelty the past several years
5883, 3, when it has came down , they seem to have their ways with great music to a whole new generation . after the of , they have instead of making fresh and new music have decided
6671, 3, there is sincerely no question that was a one of a kind that really hit the nail on the head whether it was the , the work she had done for aids and cancer , or
7633, 3, when it has came down to , she has honestly been the most artist of the past decade . yet , when it has came down to her music , she has not really hit the
6684, 4, there is question that when it has came down to songwriting this past decade , keys has honestly been her own singer songwriter . not just brilliant at what she has done , but she never
3748, 1, as a of the new met fresh super center , i actually hear this song played a lot . for , , she really does n't seem to have the appeal to really rock out loud
1534, 4, it is hard to believe that seal is his anniversary since his album right now . while he has had a lot of highs , musically and personally , the past several years have been very
6124, 4, there is no question that is a distinctive voice in gospel music that tall , yet he has had a few of the past few years . with the shocking death of his wife last year
7634, 2, when it honestly has came down to singers of today , they have sincerely lost their appeal from the heart . sadly , some artists have honestly have been so , the appeal of the songs
4210, 2, when it has came down to this past year for , she struggled from the of near fatal death after being placed in a , after a in regards to of her kids , to claiming
4167, 2, while has had a lot of hits , there are a lot of songs that she has had on her own , and with 's child that have been less than a for your music collection
6149, 5, there are honestly some songs that sound even better after the original recording . but honestly , it takes a certain magic to absolutely it from the heart , and make it all worth the effort
9262, 4, if there is one thing i honestly love about , is that she has honestly been one of the very , very few singers that really has grown with her voice nicely , and showed more
9099, 3, there is so much that robin has gone through the past several years in regards to his own career . musically , he has tried to , after losing a massive from 's family in regards
7742, 3, there honestly has n't been all that much when it has came down to real music that has spoken straight from the heart , especially in r b music . there has been so many poor
7486, 2, when it has came down to , she has not really hit the nail on the head in her voice and original rhythms as well . her song roar which she the rhythm and song which
4173, 3, when it has came down to , they 've had a mix of fair songs , but also a few great songs as well . while i was n't too thrilled about their last single gotta
2875, 5, there is no question that when it has came down to music , journey had been the most distinctive in rock music ballads . but nevertheless , they have been known for so many great songs
8469, 2, there are so few artists that seem to honestly that really stopped making songs that really came from the heart . sadly , has really been more of a product than a strong , and sadly
2369, 4, when it comes down great pleasure artists , we often seem to forget what influence they 've made on music today , especially back in the 80 's . for those acts , we always will
9195, 2, there is honestly so much that i can say about , but one thing is mostly clear , she is a product and not a real singer . when she made her surprise album in 2013
7322, 2, when it has came down to what lady has had in music , it has honestly been more of a than a driven reception . i was definitely not thrilled with the material so far she
8513, 3, there is so much that i can say that i do like about jasmine . one thing is that she can definitely sing , but honestly she has not had the set of songs for her
6838, 4, it has been awhile since came out with a new song . he has a few good songs that he has came out with from the past few years like you are , and ca n't
4948, 2, when it has deeply came right down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists in music history . not only with i am , but when you release too many singles from
2839, 5, there is honestly no question about when it comes to female singers today in song , they absolutely do not even come close to the heart and soulful of the voice of within , that others
6687, 2, when it has honestly came down to , she musically has been one the worst singers to have ever came out the past decade . when i heard she had went back to the man who
8828, 1, there is honestly a difference between when a singer is a real singer , and when a singer is more like a manufactured product . unfortunately , has been one of those artists that has been
4738, 3, it has been nearly five years since the black eyed have made music together . well , after the successful solo of , and her album the , many have wondered if the will ever make
668, 4, there just really have n't been many good songs from this past year . but for , she has been one of those few surprises that comes . her single , from her , was a
1138, 5, when it has came down to sting 's songwriting , he has shown a lot for his solo work , but that also worked very well with the of the police , and the way they
4319, 4, it is so hard to believe that there are really few female singers that really have a voice , and show that they can definitely sing from the past several years . is definitely one of
7099, 2, when it has came down to , she has n't really brought out her better songs out there . it has felt more like the same thing she has done before with her songs , which
7634, 2, when it has came down to , she has honestly been more of a product than a real singer , and unfortunately she her sound and her voice has been . overall , when it came
8959, 3, it surprises me when one song can easily get . when i had heard so many songs , i can tell whether or not the song works much better . that very rarely works , especially
9483, 3, when it has came down to and her first album , there was a lot she brought musically to the table in her songs , and her style . she really did have some songs that
7753, 3, when it has came down to , she has a lot to learn in the right set of songs , and the of voice . she so far has had a few songs that have hit
8221, 3, it is just so sad that female girl groups do not have it when it does come down to voices from the heart . girl groups used to have it , but instead have only wasted
4093, 3, when it has came down to the past year , there have been too many dance songs that have felt like they do n't make you want to get up and dance . that unfortunately has
8491, 4, there is no question that it has been very hard to see a of a single to deliver for a whole new generation . but when it has came down to the throughout earlier this year
2542, 4, there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed
4170, 2, when it honestly has came down to it , has n't really been able to with a strong single in awhile . after a few songs from i am , it is hard to tell if
2373, 4, what journey had in the way of voice and with steve is definitely a unique and brilliant blend of voice and song . yet sadly , they have tried to capture that essence without steve .
3398, 4, it has been awhile since we 've heard anything brilliant from and for quite awhile . with what they 've both had to deal with , losing her husband , and finding out he had and
4768, 3, when it has came down to rob , he has been able to make a stronger name for himself , because of his solo songwriting , as well as his recent with twenty a few years
690, 4, there are some songs that really have withstood the test of time , because of their and the appeal that really have never gotten old time after time . with joe , there are just so
5194, 4, there are just so few singers that today have been because of the of the voice alone . hard to believe that so many of them from soul r b music have passed on too young
6869, 3, there is no question that has had a mixed few years in the . she lost her and inspiration , , and has had a with 's child at the super bowl , and one of
8038, 4, there is so much that i do like about sam smith as a singer . he really has had some excellent songs over the past several years , from the stay with me , to not
5515, 4, there is no question that there has been a huge lack of great songs out there right now . but surprisingly the one nice thing is that there has been few acts that have great songs
5944, 3, when it has came down to , musically she lately does n't seem to have that feeling for , the way she scored with 2009 's all i ever wanted . while it was a huge
11473, 4, it is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and has lost their life through , and had all the talent had passed away . with the shocking and news that david had a battle with cancer
2664, 5, hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out
2994, 5, hard to believe that it has been 20 years since came out with her album , . the songs really have defined here as a in the of like , and the great . every song
11780, 5, there are just very few artists that are out there right now , that have had massive success from the 80 's that those songs still stand strong today . we have lost a lot of
9289, 3, i have honestly for the past decade , not only because they have had some really good songs that have been very down to earth like every is a , and the . but overall what
7421, 3, when it has came down to what has shown in her music from the beginning , it has been a hit and a miss . the hit came with , and the of the . the
6418, 4, it has been a very long time since made new music . company have for a long time while has had his gig with american and . but honestly , hard core fans have wanted something
1579, 4, with all the hype of green day 's new musical american idiot , they definitely have been with open arms to the community with all the of seeing their music being well to new with the
3744, 2, for those who think of was really just a poor wannabe artist , that seems what it feels like . her sound has been more like the depth of pink had shown with so what .
3026, 4, it is honestly so sad that whenever someone young and has died at a early age . the shock of the death of has been , but not a real surprised . he really was one
7370, 4, it has been a very , very long time since came out with a musical hit . she spent the past several years focusing on her work in vegas , and many have wondered if would
8181, 3, there is no question that has been a one of a kind that has delivered so well in music for over fifty years . while she has had some excellent duets over the years with on
2388, 4, it is hard to believe that it has been three years since michael jackson died . yet , his music remains in memory as he was still alive today . something that only few and far
9581, 2, it is so sad that whenever someone is , they really throw their voice away , and no longer show that they were once , and instead scared with and . sadly , has been one
5378, 3, there is no question that has really shown that he has been a good over the past several years with the soloist ray , but when it has came down to his music , he has
7633, 3, it is honestly and that whenever someone young and has made music that has been more from the music that they have made before , they feel they have to make better and they have n't
4197, 4, there is no doubt about when it has came down to male singers , rod stewart has had a brilliant way of reaching people young and old through his gift of songs . even with time
9110, 3, it has been a very long time since we have had new music from . musically , he had been from making new music for quite awhile , and a few years ago , he did
1125, 5, hard to believe it , that singers of today have been more like than the soul from the heart of the inside . but honestly , there are some singers from years ago that really have
6411, 4, when it has came down to twenty , they have n't really made a impact in music for the past several years , and rob has shown it on his own with his songs like her
8746, 2, when it has came down to what west has delivered in his art , it has sincerely been more about being , than a strong . unfortunately , his latest set of songs with paul ,
606, 5, there is honestly a difference between a singer , and being a product . unfortunately for these days like and , they have chosen to themselves and choose to be products , not people , and
7751, 4, there is no question that today 's music has mostly been a poor set of singers that ca n't hold a tune where instead they can drive a hole into your heart . but for some
7139, 4, when it has came down to , he has been known more for being a side man in music producing songs with the and being a side artist for songs like 's hit song beautiful from
8626, 1, when it has came down to , she has honestly been one of the most severely artists of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly away . west has n't
11641, 3, it is honestly and absolutely sad that someone their , to where they really do not have the that can anymore . unfortunately , had really lost her own heart and soul on her own work
7664, 2, when it has came down to , she has been a better judge lately on the voice than a strong singer . while she has had some great songs to begin with like underneath your and
4202, 5, there is no question that there are honestly few and far between singers that have absolutely withstood the test of time . not just because the songs are great , but the musician has definitely still
7619, 2, when it has came down to it , when a has became a trio , the feeling does n't shine as brilliantly as you would hope for . that honestly is the case with run this
644, 4, when it comes to making great pop rock music , no group has been able to feel as a great pleasure like five . although it has been so long since they 've made a great
6412, 4, it has been a longtime since twenty has came out with new music . while rob has had some solo success with and her a few years ago , we have n't really heard much of
9423, 2, there is a difference between a and a product . unfortunately , it has been a decade since had made it on the music scene , and she has been more of a product , not
11385, 2, when it has came down to , musically she has had a lot of to show her voice to a whole new generation . musically , all the hype she had brought out , turned out
774, 5, there is honestly so much that be said about john . his work has honestly withstood the test of time , and his songs have honestly gotten much better with age , unlike many of today
7634, 2, when it has came down to what has done musically is out of the box release a album with a surprise of hype . but sadly , the weight of her making a musical leap has
6012, 2, there is no doubt that has really been suffering musically with songs and . her music has taken a turn for the worse , and that is really gotten to her voice . where have you
10549, 4, it honestly has nearly been a full year since michael jackson died . nevertheless , he left an intimate legacy that just a generation . it is so that for the final video he did before
9389, 2, this year has really been with awful music that has really not came from the heart . has honestly been one of the worst artists to have ever came out with good music . she has
2443, 5, there are just so many songs from the movies that the great had made so , and a force that has still not been displayed in magic since the 90 's . it is unfortunately that
5518, 4, there is no question that has been one of the best to have came out of the 2000 decade . not only has she really delivered with each and every album , but her voice really
5607, 2, when it has came down to , musically , she really has n't been able to back to the top of the charts . after the and , she needed to hit on the nail on
6016, 2, when it has been down to the case with , she has honestly been known for her ways right now , than really taking seriously the drive of really making good music to call her own
11778, 4, it has been a long time since made new music that really delivered with both a young and old audience . while the past decade has brought her some ups and , with her own work
2455, 5, hard to believe that today really is 's birthday , and she would 've been 54 years old . musically , she is one of the greatest in the world , that has shown that true
11641, 2, it is honestly absolutely so sad whenever someone young and has lost themselves in pure voice and heart . had so much talent in the 90 's and in the 2000 decade when she released the
126, 4, when it came down to what has had in music , they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90 's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled
7637, 2, it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and their voice away , and they 've worn out their appeal and voice aside . unfortunately , has been one of those singers that has been more
6686, 2, when it has came down to , musically she has one of the worst ego 's in voice and absolute heart . she definitely thinks she can sing , but honestly to soul she sounds like
3102, 3, when it comes down to the hopeful from american , they 've all recently made songs that just do n't feel like they are songs that are , which is very sad . for , she
8624, 1, there is so much that could honestly be said about , and the lack of really strong songs that could be said into what made her . sadly , the lack of strong songs that led
7634, 3, when it has came down to and her voice , she has became the most product out there right now . sadly , the quality of her voice has died and has n't came back in
6682, 3, when it has came down to keys , she musically has been the best artist of the 2000 decade , because she put her voice and her talent into true art . but for her latest
1580, 4, when it comes to acts who 've made this past year , most have brought the back to the table like and the police . that also was said last year with twenty with their latest
7336, 3, it has been over twenty years since first made it big as a of with the song give u my heart from the film . but it has been a long time since made a good
2461, 5, there is honestly no question about the legacy has left behind in the music industry . more than any of today 's like the product , and . her voice defined the world in simplicity .
1508, 4, when it has honestly came down to , he just has shown one of the voices in the music industry in a very long time . yet , he just has never been able to top
2664, 5, there is absolutely no question that with r b singers , they have been more at the soul , than really feel more authentic from the heart . it has been the case with too many
11260, 4, there is no question that is one of the most vocalists of all time . but for , she has been known to beat out a favorite in the crowd . after all , she was
11514, 3, when it has came down to what had shown away from 's child , it has to the younger audience , but it still shows that she has a driven voice , considering the had shown
3356, 3, really knew what she was doing when she recorded a few years ago , these words , and . for her latest song though , it shows that can try to make a good song stand
6986, 2, when it has came down to , and the music she had from her 4th album , four , she just does n't have the voice and the connection with her songs to really match what
5094, 4, there sometimes can be a song that can really stand out well from a fresh , new face . for , she definitely has shown that well with her single from her first album , the
10964, 4, when it has came down to some artists , they are considered one hit wonders on their own , and not when were with a group . that definitely is the case with . it has
3757, 4, it is so hard to believe that is still making really good songs this past decade , heart and soul . after the success of songs like speed of sound , and the recent and dark
9482, 2, when it has came down to , she has really made a good for her own work with songs like future husband and better when i 'm from the movie . but when i had thought
6689, 3, when it has honestly came down to and ballads , most of them have absolutely been awful , except hate that i love you with yo . but other than that one , she definitely has
3179, 4, there is no question that michael jackson 's final album before he died , has had its moments from in the , from michael 's feelings of of , to poor reviews . nevertheless , there
5982, 2, when it has came down to the cast of , they have shown to be just wannabe singers , who 've made songs that are strong into weak little that were not meant to be broken
7418, 3, when it has came down to female artists from the , they have n't been striking in regards to music lately . of course , that showed examples from a few years ago from acts like
2826, 4, when it comes to really good r b , there are very few that 've shown that heart like keys . after the success of her , songs in a minor , unplugged and of keys
4222, 4, for , they 've really made a lot of great songs this past decade from the and of , to the mellow and deep of speed of sound , show that they 've definitely made their
10019, 4, when it has came down to musicians , there are much fewer and farther between that have made it worth while . . john though has one of those musicians that has made the most brilliant
7587, 3, when it has came down to , she has tried so hard to get past the one hit wonder phase of her career , after the smash success of of a few years ago . but
9591, 4, this past year we have already lost a lot of in music whom have died before their time and fell to the waste side before our eyes , from to david and white of earth ,
9482, 2, it is sincerely sad that whenever someone is on top of their game with good music , can actually have a set of songs that can cause them to lose control with their . has been
6689, 3, when it has came down to what has shown musically with , they absolutely have been more than actual hits in her career . she has had one good when she did work with yo on
6726, 3, when it has came down to and his music , mostly all of it has really been god right now . but every so often when an artist who is very good , can make a
3426, 4, it is just so sad that there really have n't been any who 've made it in the industry . after the appeal of the from american and poor record sales , it has been very
7050, 2, what i simply and always say , is that when a artist has to come out with a song , they do n't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice . for to
4647, 2, when it has came down to it , there just honestly have been very few that struck the strength of the song . sadly , that has not really been a good case this year ,
7421, 2, there is no question that has had one of the biggest from the past year with the success of her song . but after that , she honestly has n't seemed to show that she has
3351, 4, hard to believe that it has been over four years since michael jackson sadly passed away the way he died . it is still one of the most of all time , and shows the he
5606, 2, there is no question that has been a lot of the news lately , and not for her music . it has been for her work with american , and for her to in a sour
111, 5, there is honestly so much that could be said about joe and his gifts in song . the guy was honestly one of the most amazing singers that had ever came out of the . he
6688, 3, when it has came down to with ballads , they have been both cheesy in song , and honestly in voice . that showed for the past few years in weak songs like california king bed
5128, 4, while there has n't been really strong acts lately who 've made good music , it sometimes seems that those that 've been down for the count that have returned , came back with great songs
6147, 4, i have always loved george michael musically , because he has been one of the most soulful singers i have ever enjoyed at the soul of the voice within . which is something many of today
7444, 3, when it has came down to what has done in music , it might be genius to some , but others it might actually have hurt her in voice and . 's latest have n't actually
5958, 4, there is no question about the and have had with trying to follow up the strength of la since it came out in 2008 . but what does have is strength and a real connection with
9288, 3, there is honestly so much that i do adore about . yet , it has been quite awhile since they have really came out with a great song . overall , i was not really thrilled
9423, 2, it is absolutely so sad that a artist can push the envelope so much , that they are just so tiring and more annoying in their music . , is one of those artists that really
7210, 5, when it has came down to john , he has stood the test of time , more than any singer songwriter of the past 40 years . still , his classics have never lost their after
5603, 4, when it had came down to over his lifetime , what he had made out of his life , was a striking and soulful era of music that has n't lost its through time . on
7210, 5, there is no question that when john makes a song come alive , it has to be worth its listen too , and the simplicity of the heart and the piano keys . that has showed
7210, 5, when it has came down to john , he is one of the very few and strong musicians that not only is still standing strong today , but someone who still knows after all this time
8517, 2, when it has came down to in her music and her , she really has n't brought out her strength in her songs . what is shown from the tracks from the , she just had
8314, 3, when it has came down to j . , she has had some really good music in her life and career , but she has n't hit the nail on the head with strong music .
8341, 3, it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and from the legendary of soul , . she has not made any new music for years . so when i had heard
9476, 3, there is so much that could be said about . musically , she has used her voice to strike back against her to in . while she had drove well with her music , it is
7919, 2, there is no question that when it has came down to female singers , they have had a drive in having really good songs . has been one of those singers who has honestly been and
6303, 4, there has n't been many new artists that have had good song that came out this year . for , she has had a lot to prove in so many ways , with her songs and
3687, 4, there is no doubt about . chris martin and company have shown that they can appeal to so many different because the songs just deliver heart and soul . but , many alternative rock fans have
7485, 2, there is no question that has had her share of good songs with her fans , but there are some songs that are not even worth the voice , and absolutely not worth the time .
3351, 4, hard to believe that it has been over four years since michael jackson sadly passed away the way he died . it is still one of the most of all time , and shows the he
5182, 2, there is no question that when it has came down to , she has shown that there can sometimes be too much of a to make music for . it can be good for some ,
11158, 4, there is no there there has been a lack of good songs and new acts this year . from the of the sound of and , to lack of great rhythms by others , people just
7786, 4, when it has came down to what is dealing with right now , they have n't had the real delivery they have had with past works like la and a rush of to the head .
9728, 4, there is no question that when it has club , boy george has been the face of what made them a brilliant 80 's band . but as the success had faded , so did his
1125, 5, there are just some songs that have remained very constant within a simple artist , that they take your breath away each and every time you hear them . sting has been one of those musicians
11600, 4, there is no question about what i do love about is the simplicity and of her voice . her songs from her work with like un break my heart have ultimately withstood the test of time
11762, 3, there is honestly so much that can be said about . he honestly has been one of the greatest singer in regards to r b music . yet , he has been from making decent music
7890, 2, there are definitely sometimes where a artist can get so , that the quality of the songs dies as well as the heart in the mind . for ed , who based hip music to his
9452, 4, it has been a very long time since we have had any new music from . hard to believe that it has been a decade since she broke big with her hit , like a star
9054, 4, there is so much that can be said about don , and the legacy he has shown in the music industry . yet , it is a quiet and simple approach to his own music .
8532, 3, there is honestly so much that can be said about the long of fall out boy , and the real return to their fans and great legacy . they definitely took when they had with .
5328, 2, there is no question that the past year in music really brought in a lot of wasted talent on songs , and artists as well . that has definitely came the case from joke songs like
9421, 2, it is absolutely sad that whenever someone whom is young and , has thrown their voice away , by not finding better in her own works . , has really made some of the worst songs
7637, 2, when it has came down to , she is the most annoying and artist of the past decade , and sadly the heart of her voice , has died and she has died in voice and
10610, 5, there is no question about it that there are very few and farther between singers that really have came from the heart in today 's music . but for female r b singers , they just
2445, 4, there is no question about my heart on the world losing . i have never felt so hurt in all of my life , but i am so glad that everyone is of how important and
7893, 4, there is honestly so much that i have loved about the simplicity of ed , and his own work . musically , he has written some excellent songs over the past few years . while i
599, 5, there is honestly a difference between a song that is a waste of time , and a song that can be from the soul . wonder has honestly been one of those very few that has
4915, 3, there are very few new artists that have shown a strong interest musically this past year . but for , , she does show that she can really rock very loud . as she was planning
5659, 2, the feeling of what lady has made into music being all her own , well there is no question that she is not someone whom is delivering her own music . she has shown to take
2788, 4, it is just so sad that had just died recently . he had such a very nice down to earth appeal that was dynamic and so , that it just your heart away . but when
10438, 4, there is no doubt keys , and the strength of her music . not only are her songs strong and straight from the soul and heart , but she has much better songs than those wannabe
3321, 4, it is so sad to know that it has been 10 years since , the lead vocalist of the lost his battle with cancer at 53 years old . while so many people have honestly turned
8440, 4, there is honestly a difference between a person and a product . for artists like and , they have been more about products than actual singers . sadly , they had stopped delivering in real quality
7317, 2, when it has came down to what music has today , it has been more than anything that is really worth meaning in voice . for she has had a whole lot to prove in music
7871, 3, when it has came down to what made michael jackson a real legend is the real rhythm into what made his songs . but after his passing in 2009 , it has been very hard for
3906, 2, for david , the up from american this year who lost to david , he has n't actually been able to really deliver well , from the show , or on his own . even a
5378, 3, when it has came down to , his acting has really been going places . but , his music has been into sour . it has been very hard for him to top what he had
6728, 3, when comes out with songs , he has been both a hit and a miss . while some of his songs have been very strong from like locked out of heaven , there have been other
6862, 4, there is no question about . she honestly has one of the most classic and distinctive voices in r b of the past several years . yet , she has been very heavily in music for
5266, 3, it has been over a year since rod stewart has released a record , and unfortunately he did . after the album last year , and his mixed still the same rock classics cover album ,
796, 5, when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england ,
878, 4, often , there are times a song can touch you simply from the heart . when it comes to , they had struggled for years trying to make it happen in the scene . but ,
4860, 3, when it has came down to uncle , he has made some delightful and enjoyable songs worth listening to . while his past songs like his with gray on the classic away , the simple single
8539, 4, honestly , there are few and far between songs that have been more than worthwhile from the 2000 decade . there have been more songs about the artists images , rather than the from the heart
7632, 2, it is honestly and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and has wasted their talent away , by making songs that have honestly more mediocre , that from the heart . unfortunately , has been
3102, 3, when it comes down to the hopeful from american , they 've all recently made songs that just do n't feel like they are songs that are , which is very sad . for , she
7420, 4, there have been very few artists that really have came out with very , very good songs the first time out that have been completely worthwhile . for , , she has absolutely had a lot
7638, 2, it is sincerely so sad that when a artist has been so , that the quality of their voice has slowly and surely passed away . has been severely so , that the quality of her
9589, 2, it is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone whom is young and has thrown their own voice away , by making music that really does n't from the heart , and instead hears exactly what
105, 4, there are just some artists that have been so over the years , that they have been just so classy from the soul . joe was one of those soulful that had a very , sweet
5942, 3, when it has came down to , she honestly has n't had very strong songs , since her first few records . while she has had the most success from her american days a decade ago
2839, 5, there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart
5821, 2, when it has came down to 's last album rated r , she just really did n't have the songs to shine upon and deliver , in the ways that good girl gone bad had delivered
1519, 4, it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one
3334, 2, when it has came down to , and today 's , she has became the most product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs
7867, 3, hard to believe that it has almost been five years since michael jackson died the way he did of his and . i absolutely know he never forgot all the years he was judged as a
7322, 2, when it has came down to lady , she has lost her crown in her music and her message from driven voice and innovation from her music . she had a lot to prove and she
8288, 4, when it has came down to female singers , they sincerely have stopped coming from the heart . for others who have tried hard to make their mark like , they have not had that full
660, 4, there is so much you can say about from her fame as part of the black eyed . but , her solo the has had a few surprise songs . big girls do n't cry ,
9581, 2, it is so sad that someone young and has became more of a product , than a real . unfortunately for , she has been more of a product than a real singer . it is
11473, 4, when it has came down to what david had made in his music for generations , he really let his music speak for itself , and his soul had shown to be . yet , while
9155, 2, it is absolutely so sad that someone young and that has a great head on their shoulders , away their own voice in regards to trying to capturing a younger audience . has had a lot
4950, 2, when it has came down to lady , it seems as if she is trying to get the that a lot of the younger wannabe acts have had like and . unfortunately for her , that
7638, 2, when it has came down to , she has been the most artist of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice has died in each and every note she has . for
6671, 3, when it has came down to , the voice stands taller than everyone else . but when the world found out she died , it was beyond what words could be beyond said . but with
4964, 3, when it has came down to the impact of , really the world by the way she has shown it is the voice on the inside that is suppose to count . while that was shown
3398, 4, it has been awhile since we 've heard anything brilliant from and for quite awhile . with what they 've both had to deal with , losing her husband , and finding out he had and
9421, 2, i have been honestly very tired of making very poor choices in her own sound , and her music . she has really wasted her own , and her own time in finding less than the
4264, 2, it is hard to tell who is right now . after his public so called rant on , many people have him and his role as a performer . but for his latest single , blame
5515, 4, there is no question that there are very few artists out there right now , that absolutely know how to sing , and coming out the songs that show it . for , whom came out
7261, 4, there is no question that has been the band of our times that really has made some very excellent songs that have gotten better with age . but out of all of the songs had made
891, 4, it is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and dies early before their time . with the shocking news of the passing of chris of , it is just another reminder of rock roll excess from
2327, 4, there is no question that train has shown a strong return to the this past year as one of the of the past decade . while they just have n't had the sales that have shown
4949, 2, there is no question that sometimes there can be too much of an artist , that it does honestly feel like it can be more and bothered than it really was before . that honestly is
8565, 3, it honestly has been a very long time since d came out with anything new in music . it has been over a decade since he came out with ( how does it feel , )
2839, 5, there is honestly no question about when it comes to female singers today in song , they absolutely do not even come close to the heart and soulful of the voice of within , that others
6399, 4, there are so very few songs that really do with simplicity and the simple mood and mood of voice and song in this day that work based on heart . group has hit that nail on
10452, 4, whenever i do think of keys , i do know that she is a strong soulful that has never gotten older with age , her songs have honestly gotten better with time space . she has
7393, 3, when it has came down to the music industry , we really have n't had many artists that have really delivered in the heart well . for , so much of the focus has really been
7357, 3, there is no question that has had a lot trying to improve and her way out of child fame after the success she had with . it did work nicely at the beginning , but sadly
4200, 5, there is no question about the lack of really good songs out there right now . so to me , i think turning back the clock on a lot of great pop classics has been a
8624, 1, when it has came down to , she honestly has been more like a joke with her music , than taking her music t the next level . the songs that she had for her album
4221, 2, when it has came down to it , we honestly have n't seen many strong cover songs lately . considering so many r b acts have been just taking instead samples like with never ever sampling
8372, 5, there is honestly no question that when it has came down to great hard rock , they just cannot get out of the head , and hit you in the soul of the heart . has
4212, 2, when it has came down to the past few years , it is really hard to tell whether she is back on track like a rose , or having another . unfortunately her latest single t
8518, 3, it is honestly and absolutely sad that someone who has the talent , just has not even shown it has the to show for it . , who has been out there for the past several
2239, 5, hard to believe it has been two years since the world has lost an iconic legend , . but nevertheless , her voice will always past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most
11589, 2, when it has honestly came down to , she has been more of a product in voice , than really has her work outside from her heart . honestly when it has came to all the
5431, 4, there has honestly been no question that has been one of the most recognized in gospel music the past several years . but every now and then , they can bring the influence into the fairly
9423, 2, it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone is and does n't even make really good music that sounds different from what they did before , and the different music that the artist makes , is
4638, 1, there is no doubt about when a song gets by another artist , most of the time , it feels like it has been a waste on the ears . that has been said for ,
6683, 4, 2012 has been a very sad year for music . for keys , she has had a rough year , losing her friend , and then singing at her . but nevertheless , she also has
5468, 4, when it has came down to the script , there are some people whom thought that the script would be labeled as a one hit wonder with the mass appeal of . the song actually was
2912, 5, when it came down to back in 2000 , she had to after a . but when it has came down to her ballads , they 've been very . that is definitely the case with
6412, 4, it has been awhile since the guys from twenty have came out with a good song . it has been over 15 years since their the with yourself or someone like you . but even with
10856, 2, with all the hype surrounding the , and their last single , when i grow up , it remains unfortunate that they have n't really hit that nail on the head when it comes to the
2369, 4, when it comes down great pleasure artists , we often seem to forget what influence they 've made on music today , especially back in the 80 's . for those acts , we always will
6584, 4, there is no question that the past year has brought out some really bad songs in music and for radio . for , he has had the challenge of trying to drive and stay relevant in
7638, 3, when it has came down to and the word she has a surprise record coming out through itunes , many of her fans went absolutely in shock . but sadly , just because you are a
4995, 3, when i first heard lady recently , i was deeply surprised how good their music really was with their pop hit need you now . but , it is honestly very heavy and hard to try
9485, 3, it honestly is surprising that someone whom has a lot of talent has lost it with having her voice , and that is very rare that someone can have that happen . unfortunately , for ,
3625, 3, there are no doubts about , and her constant vocals that have shown that there is no holding her down . but , there are those few songs that honestly just are n't some of her
8645, 2, there is no question that when it has came down to music , has honestly been one of the worst acts to have came out with music the past several years . musically , her last
4867, 4, it is just so sad that whenever someone young and away so soon , you 're really often of the great talent they left behind at the soul . has had so many great songs from
4795, 2, there honestly is no question about the lack of great songs on the radio out there . for , she honestly has had a lot of songs that have really been in place on the radio
5378, 3, there is no question that has had a strong set as a and singer . with acting , he had won a oscar with ray , paying and delivering a strong performance as the late ray
798, 5, there is no question that when it has came down to music , john has honestly been one of the most universal and strong , not just in his music , but how relevant he stays
2445, 5, when it has came down to 's best movie songs , the one that is always turned to is the i will always love you from the . but to follow it up with waiting to
2694, 5, when it has came down to journey , they 've honestly been one of the best in rock music . while it is honestly a shame that they have n't scored well with anything new after
5548, 2, honestly for chris brown , he just really has had a harsh time in the , since the from the abuse with . unfortunately , it showed with the strength of , and it is still
6961, 1, when it has came down to robin 's music , he has had some really good ballads and definite love songs like lost without u , and the sweetest thing as well as magic . but
4609, 2, with the surprise success of best picture at the , there always can be a sense of with a song from a film that can be a . that is said strongly with this version of
4157, 2, it is such a that a lot of artist now are coming out with songs that feel like the acts are just shells of themselves from what they had made good a few years ago .
1190, 3, for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time ,
4966, 4, when it has came down to keys , she definitely has the and ability to carry a strong tune with her songs . that has honestly shown well with her latest album , the element of
2438, 4, there are some songs that are just meant to be covered , where in this case there are some songs that had been worth sampling over time . when ray jr . came out with the
1580, 4, when it comes to acts who 've made this past year , most have brought the back to the table like and the police . that also was said last year with twenty with their latest
7095, 3, when it has came down to , she has had some very heavy to fill . that is the case with the songs that her sister , has shown in her voice , and her music
7229, 4, when it has came down to what has shown in her songs , they are definitely very good . she not only has made good songs so far , but delivers very true to her sound
3770, 2, honestly , 2008 has proven to be the year of the wannabe in the music industry , and out of all of those , nobody has been more than . while she may feel like she
3071, 4, utmost , it is honestly very sad whenever someone who has a gift , it away and on . that is sadly the case with david . after all of the and success in the family
2485, 4, the music of the 70 's today has shown a effect on what we hear on radio and on television today . although there are times where we see the past as something better than the
5849, 3, there is no question that to so many , has been the of the american era . but just being the 1st winner of the of reality , does n't mean you really have the best
774, 5, there is no question that this year marks john 's anniversary since he met and became one of the most songwriting in the world . there have been so many classics that have been so strong
358, 4, when it has came down to , they have honestly been one of the most distinctive and acts to have ever came out of the 2000 decade . hard to believe that it has been over
11223, 4, it is honestly so whenever someone young and dies at a early age in life , you sometime want to cry with the heart . that is what has happened with the death of george michael
4737, 2, there is no doubt that the black eyed really have n't been able to score the massive success they 've had a few years ago with songs like where is the love ? and do n't
792, 4, these days it is much harder to actually find singers that have shown simplicity in song where it is actually worthwhile in heart . that is something today 's have taken for granted in song .
2155, 5, while it is hard to believe that so many people have listed cross as a one album wonder . but , his music has been very and , that it is worth taking a listen too
7893, 4, there are some songs that can really deliver from their simplicity at the soul . but these days it can be very hard to hear what they are , largely because the radio play has been
5887, 3, it seems like whenever there is a of a classic film , it seems to shine in the way the original scored with movie . that honestly was the case with the of earlier this year
8501, 3, there is honestly so much that can be said about traditional r b . there really has been a huge lag on real music today , especially the heart of real r b . unfortunately ,
7881, 3, when it came down to ed , he had some really great songs when he a few years ago with the a team and house . now , he is trying to follow up what made
3757, 4, there is no question that has been the band of our times that really has made some very excellent songs that have gotten better with age . but out of all of the songs had made
7636, 2, when it has came down to , and the surprise she has made for releasing a surprise album , she sadly has made the wrong choices in making great music from her heart , and instead
223, 5, it is sincerely sad whenever someone young and dies before your heart . knew that feeling , not just with the death of her beloved father , the great king , but also in , with
6535, 3, when it has came right down to , she musically has n't been able to drive in her songs in the way other artists have been able to deliver . yet sadly , her last two
4171, 2, when it has came down to music lately , there honestly have been a lot of weaker songs that what really has delivered a few years ago on radio . for even , they have n't
1527, 4, there is no words to describe the news of today that had passed away at age 57 . with a set of in r b we 've lost this year with , white of earth ,
2904, 2, it is honestly so sad when a artist has became so , that they have n't been able to shine the way the used to when they were younger . unfortunately , has been one of
5146, 2, when it has honestly came down to lately , his songs just have n't deeply strongly showed what he has been able to prove back nearly a decade ago . his songs like hero and could
5680, 3, when it has came down to , there have been some songs over his life and career that were good and driven in his life that where clever . but for his latest project bad meets
902, 4, there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's
9381, 4, there is so much going on with the great right now . musically , he had been from making new music for quite awhile to deal with personal issues from having back surgery to take care
3356, 3, really knew what she was doing when she recorded a few years ago , these words , and . for her latest song though , it shows that can try to make a good song stand
7795, 4, it is so sad that is set to from making new music , after 50 years as a , and one of the most universal and artists to have ever the stage . he has had
3708, 3, there honestly has not really a lot of great music that has came out this past year , which is very sad . it is just surprising that artists from the have really shown their stuff
8469, 2, when it has came down to , she has been more of a product than a real singer . sadly , the quality of her being a singer has died , and the heart of her
6370, 3, this past year has already been one of the all over the world . no further is meant and said by the and horrible death of . her impact on music has definitely been the most
2650, 4, it is absolutely so sad that a love that was had faded away . unfortunately , for , she has been hit with so much in her personal life from two n her beloved heart .
2155, 5, while it is hard to believe that so many people have listed cross as a one album wonder . but , his music has been very and , that it is worth taking a listen too
8900, 4, if there is honestly one thing i am very critical of , is that most of today 's female singers do not even know how to really sing from the heart , especially in r b
8326, 1, when it has came down to , she honestly has one of the worst that has came out in 2014 . her album has honestly failed to impress not just in music , but sadly going
4120, 4, there honestly has been a huge lack of artists with really driven and strong songs . for the script , whom had broke out well earlier this year with , they definitely have been one of
6863, 4, the past few years , there have been a lack of real voices that really have truly shown their essence in knowing what it is like to really sing . has really made her voice well
3, 4, while it has been six months since the and death of michael jackson , many people have recently what had made him such a strong and singer , and the he was . not the he
4172, 4, it has been three years since originally released her last album b day , and a lot has changed in her life . she got married to her longtime z , and hard to believe her
3991, 4, there is no question that has been one of the most and entertaining performers whom has any stage from acting in movies , to singing , to being a performer on . yet , the biggest
7945, 2, when it has came down to , he has put out a lot of strong music when he was dealing with his like , and vs . , but sadly there are a lot of songs
4169, 3, when it has came down to she has had a mixed of songs . while her dance songs have lost a lot of her appeal like her recent single , , her ballads have been showing
6247, 3, so far this year , has shown she has a lot of loss on her plate . not only dealing with the trial in regards to the of her mother and , but also the and
792, 4, these days it is much harder to actually find singers that have shown simplicity in song where it is actually worthwhile in heart . that is something today 's have taken for granted in song .
2512, 5, there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in
7996, 2, when it has came down to and her music right now , she does n't really deliver . not just in her music , but her to nick has absolutely failed . her album me i
8019, 3, when it has came down to j . , she has had some really great songs , and others that have n't been able to hit the nail on the head . the songs that she
9540, 3, there really have not been all that many songs that have really drove from the world of country music the past several years . the songs have either been gently from one zone in sales ,
2239, 5, it is hard to believe that today is the first anniversary since 's death . while the music industry has seen dramatic changes , what it has not been able to show is a and depth
7996, 3, when it has honestly came about , she has n't really her heart enough into her music . sadly , that showed that she lost her in her last song , which proved to be less
4091, 2, when it comes down to new artists , they either have it , or they just do n't . for lady , who made a with just dance , she does n't seem to hit that
8607, 5, there is honestly no question about 's return to the . with her album i look to you at one on , and selling 300 , 000 copies the opening week , there is no doubt
2461, 5, it is so sad that of today 's , they sincerely do not have voices anymore that spoke from the soul of the voice within . yet , when i do think of today 's in
4171, 1, it has honestly been very sad , whenever someone who is as a , becomes so severely , that they are unfortunately a manufactured product than a real person . sadly , is one of those
11506, 4, it has been a very long time since the goo goo had made a really good song . the past several years had shown some fitting songs to keep them alive , but not as strong
4873, 2, there has no been question about . she has been under a lot of pressure to really deliver with a strong cover . she has had a lot of weak cover songs that she has done
10416, 4, there is no question that has always been one of a kind , not just in his music , but simply of how his are in song , not just because they are great , but
5822, 2, when it has came down to , she has honestly made some of the worst music in the modern era . but it is n't just that , she also has been that it is more
6589, 3, when it has came down to , she has honestly been one of the artists that has ever came out of the past several years , and really made music that really has wasted away her
9421, 2, it is honestly and absolutely so sad that someone whom has became a product , not a real singer has made more songs that make them just and more annoying at the soul . , has
6522, 3, when it has came down to green day musically , they have been one of the best rock acts to have ever broke through during the 90 's . musically , since came out , they
7632, 2, when it has came down to , she has been a product as a singer , and not really a human singer . sincerely , and sadly the quality of her songs have absolutely been awful
10401, 4, there is simply no question about the legacy that has left behind in this world . she has had songs that have sincerely set the world on fire and delivered throughout the best of times and
10854, 3, there are sometimes that a can deliver a decent song , but could have more to offer . for , she has had a lot she had to prove not only because there have been very
7617, 3, when it has came down to the cast of , they actually have n't hit the nail on the head in regards to having good music from the heart . in fact , mostly all of
8855, 2, it is honestly so sad that someone young and has not really made the mark that they had made , to make the music in their life come alive . , who has had a lot
4449, 4, there is no question that 2012 has already proven to be a year for music and deep in the world . for the boys , nobody has even thought that would lose his life at the
8439, 3, when it has came down to what taylor has done in music , it is one of a kind . but there can be times where one great artist , can sometimes have a song or
9645, 4, it has been a very long time since made a impact with making deep music . when he released his 2009 album night , it came at a time when we were going through a death
3715, 3, when it has came down to it , three doors down have had a difficult time getting their music out on the scene for the past couple of years . with their latest album , they
1122, 4, if there is honestly one thing that i do adore about sting , is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own . he has been doing it for 30
9219, 4, there is so much that can be said about great covers . many of the artists of today , do not even know what the words can be described for of what a great song from
8369, 4, it is always sad whenever someone young and dies at a early age . for this , it was a . hearing about the death of young , one of the musical of ac dc ,
2438, 4, there are some songs that are just meant to be covered , where in this case there are some songs that had been worth sampling over time . when ray jr . came out with the
7444, 3, when it has came down to , she has tried so hard to and shed her teen image from her days , yet she made become more in her work and definitely lost her in her
7337, 3, it has been twenty years since made her first album , and it introduced a beautiful who really has known her voice and . but for her up with for the first time in years ,
2233, 4, there are some musicians that do n't have to prove to a younger generation what classic music really is . for , who has made great pop songs for nearly 20 years , his song still
9068, 5, there are honestly some songs that sound even better after the original recording . but honestly , it takes a certain magic to absolutely it from the heart , and make it all worth the effort
4057, 3, for pink , this past year has really been a tough year for her . after her with her husband , she still has shown she has a great face in appeal with her music .
4094, 2, there sometimes can be an artist that feels like an imitation of something else , or just make so many songs that feel like they are absolutely a waste of time . for lady , she
9414, 3, there has been a lack of soul and traditional r b from the music industry for the past several years . they have been more severely by and hip , which has really at real over
4795, 2, when it has came down to , she has n't been able to strike that nail on the head with her music lately . the songs on her latest album , of an have been very
6719, 4, if there is one thing i absolutely love about , is that she has had some really good songs written for her . when she hit it big back in the 90 's , she really
4210, 2, for , her life has really been placed on too much overdrive . with her recently on good morning america , and her recent on for the record , she has shown that she has been
4092, 3, when it has came down to lady , she has n't really been able to make a good song all her own . after the she had used for , and just dance . for her
9173, 3, there is so much that can be said about the legacy of . he has been one of the most innovative and driven of the past forty years in soul , funk and r b .
2851, 4, it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it
2069, 4, hard to believe that it has been 15 years since the death of michael , and the end of . musically the 80 's have been very strong to them with kick , and their ,
4765, 4, when it has came down it , there are honestly very few singers right now that simply touch you in the heart , that are n't all about gimmicks or fancy gloss , just a simple
6013, 2, when it has came right down to , she has honestly been one of the most artists of the past several years , whom has honestly made some of the most songs to have ever came
4901, 4, i really often can find some deep and interesting surprises that can really be interesting when i least expect it . while i have n't heard anything from michael as a single that went into the
2989, 3, there is no question that when it has came down to what michael jackson has simply done in music , it honestly has been one of a kind as the king of pop . but when
9483, 3, i have honestly been intrigued by what had done musically , ever since she had released her song from the movie , better when i 'm . but honestly , with all the hype that she
6544, 3, when it has came down to the script , when i first heard the guys from , i was very skeptical about what i wanted to hear with their music . i have definitely loved their
4627, 2, there is honestly no doubt about the fact that there are very few artists that feel like they can hit the right nail on the head . but for , she honestly has n't been able
6589, 2, when it has came down to , she honestly has been the most artist of the past several years , where her voice has lost its , and she really has n't stopped for . musically
3957, 3, when it has came down to it , there just has n't been that much with the music industry this past year . there have been some surprisingly songs though , like that 's not my
5398, 3, when it has came down to sampling classic songs , it just does n't drive as the original songs that were made so special . that was shown strongly with earlier this year with your love
8862, 2, it has been a very long time since we have heard anything new from . while he has had some good songs from for your entertainment , he has not been able to definitely follow up
5225, 4, it is very hard to believe but nearly 35 years since john was , and the world lost a musical giant . his songs still stand taller on broad and stronger than most of today 's
6589, 2, when it has came down to in music , she has honestly been sadly looked more like a product than a real singer . not only that , but the quality of her songs have easily
1579, 4, with all the hype of green day 's new musical american idiot , they definitely have been with open arms to the community with all the of seeing their music being well to new with the
7890, 2, there is no question that ed really has let his sound go in his songs . while he has been more by and hip acts like z and others , it really has n't brought out
6087, 4, for jason , he has had a impossible gamble , to try and follow up with his massive hit i 'm yours . but , he honestly has delivered well with his latest single i wo
3179, 4, there is no question that michael jackson 's final album before he died , has had its moments from in the , from michael 's feelings of of , to poor reviews . nevertheless , there
9632, 3, throughout the past several few decades for , they have had excellent movie songs that have really stood the test of time , in regards to the warmth and brilliant heart that have grown with our
3426, 4, there s no question that when a winner is from american , or the show x factor , most of the time they have n't had the real smash success that has remained , with exceptions
5230, 5, there is no question about why john was a deep one of a kind soul . what he brought into the world musically was deep music and that they still stand the of time . his
8855, 2, it is honestly , and sincerely so sad that whenever someone young and , has really run out of ideas , with making better for her own music , and better to her own voice .
9310, 4, there is so much that i do love about . but it has been a very long time since we have heard some really good songs from his remarkable career in song . when i had
9599, 4, it is so surprisingly that has made some really good songs after he had left n sync . honestly , there are some that had been a little like and others that have been more like
3186, 4, when it came down heart , they 've been of the in country music in the 80 's and 90 's . while the groups career has in the past several years , it still can
6361, 3, when it has came down to pink , she has with a lot of joy in her life . being a mother , and letting her music shine as well . she has a lot of
9421, 2, it is honestly and absolutely sad when someone young and has thrown their voice away . unfortunately has been one of those singers that has been more of a product , than a real singer .
3334, 2, when it has came down to , and today 's , she has became the most product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs
4059, 3, when it has came down to pink 's recent release , , it has n't shown to be as strong as the feeling she had from some of her earlier songs . that also showed on
6038, 4, it is so hard to think of how sad and shallow it was for to drink her life away , after being and by her own fans after returning to the stage . nevertheless , her
2327, 4, there is no question that train has shown a strong return to the this past year as one of the of the past decade . while they just have n't had the sales that have shown
4806, 4, there is no question about city and the joy that has been shown with last year , and the song and its and music video about forgotten toys and youth . for his latest single ,
5296, 4, it has been a year since michael released crazy love , and he brought out his driven pop style to a whole new audience with have n't met you yet , which became a and nice
8009, 3, when it has came down to the members of 's child today , they honestly do not have the today , they honestly do not even have the they used to in their songs . it
4121, 4, there just have n't really been many great songs that 've came out this past year so far . but the ones that have came out from lesser known acts finally making it have definitely been
10783, 4, there is no question about the great pleasure , . they 've made rock seem cool everytime they come back into the music scene . their latest single , and , the first single from their
2108, 4, there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just
11101, 4, there is no question about the sound that john has carried over the years . it has just gotten better with age . while that has n't shown that in record sales on his last records
8469, 2, it is honestly absolutely so sad whenever someone who is young and gets so , they become more like a product than a real singer and . sadly , that honestly is the case with ,
7358, 3, when it had came down to , she had a bit of trouble trying to shed her god girl image , because of her success of . but sadly , that had hurt her on her
46, 4, it is honestly very sad whenever someone young and dies early . that has been the case already with the passing of their voice , , whom died back in late after having a battle with
11010, 5, there is honestly so much that you can say about female artists , especially in r b today . they absolutely had stopped coming from the heart , but for others there has been a long
6013, 2, when it has came down to , she has been one of the most artists of the past several years . yet , her songs have made her very annoying , and not really a strong
11793, 2, it is sad whenever someone young and does not even come close to delivering at the soul of the voice , and instead falling by the . for , she has been trying to into hood
4285, 1, there is no doubt that there are some artists who 've made some songs that have felt like flavor of the moment , and those who 've made songs that are just . that sadly is
886, 4, it is honestly a moment , whenever somebody dies with a broken heart . when i had heard about the death of o , whom had the throughout the 90 's , i was shocked .
2239, 5, i could not believe the news of hearing that has died . i am deeply beyond what words can even express . her voice is always going to be a and beautiful gem . but when
2826, 4, when it comes to really good r b , there are very few that 've shown that heart like keys . after the success of her , songs in a minor , unplugged and of keys
7739, 4, when it has honestly came down to artists sampling other singers , there has to be a very classy and distinctive style to follow in suite . for anyone whom samples a john song , they
7483, 2, when it has came down to , and the music she has put out , she just does n't into what she had brought out when she ha started with i a girl a few years
11706, 3, when it has came down to west , his music has honestly been more mixed than anything that really than anything that really strikes the word genius . sadly , the songs do not when it
8259, 4, if there honestly is shown about female singers of today like , and is that they have sincerely stopped coming from the heart . their songs have honestly made them feel more wasted than strong in
5564, 1, when it has came down to , musically she has lost her way in her music . after the performance at good morning america this week , many people are starting to wonder whether she really
3081, 3, for those who 've won american after did back in , they 've had a much harder time of making their own in the music industry . for last years , , she has shown some
7357, 3, when it has came down to , musically she has not been able to hit the nail on the head with voice and heart . her last album ca n't be tamed was absolutely awful .
7357, 2, when it has came down to what has been doing in music , it has been trying so hard to strip away from her image . she failed to it with her ca n't be tamed
4873, 3, it is so sad that someone like has been very poor and weak in regards to her songs that she has covered . honestly , throughout 's career , she really has been very poor at
2650, 4, it is absolutely so sad that a love that was had faded away . unfortunately , for , she has been hit with so much in her personal life from two n her beloved heart .
5575, 4, there is no question that when it has came down to the , they 've made some extremely funny music videos over the years . but if there is one thing that they are not as
3745, 2, there honestly is no question about the lack of really good . for whom had scored with i a girl a year ago from her record , one of the boys , her latest single does
8468, 1, it honestly is absolutely sad that whenever someone young and has all the talent in the world , can sincerely throw their career away . unfortunately , is one of those singers , who has became
5021, 2, when it has came down to pop music right now , it has definitely gone to be pretty lately for so many younger female acts . with songs from , and now with ha , there
7349, 3, when it has came down to what the family has tried to do with music , none of them have delivered as strongly as did with in songs and heart . for to follow what did
5183, 2, there is no question that there is a lack of really striking music out there . with , she has n't really grown into her music , and brought out a real feeling of strength where
5959, 3, there is no question that when it has came down to over the last decade , they have been the most distinctive group when it has came down to music . but they have n't yet
5015, 4, there is no question about , and the she had to personally to as a single mom , and with the appeal of being as a artist . but , when it had came down to
9026, 4, i am not a huge fan of heavy metal , but honestly it is very surprising to take a spin of great covers . when i heard about , i was not really a huge fan
5551, 4, there is no question that chris brown has been through a lot in the . after being labeled as a girl beater from his with for a long while , he has really went through his
7992, 4, when it has really came down to jason , he actually has been making some songs that have absolutely delivered , not just in great melody , but keeps up showing why the best songs have
11480, 3, when it has came down to , she has honestly the most artist of the past decade . for female artists , it has mainly been about her and everyone else , can go to the
3768, 2, when it comes down to great young role models , there are few and far between like from . sadly , though even though she does make a good example for young women , she can
2445, 4, there is no question about my heart on the world losing . i have never felt so hurt in all of my life , but i am so glad that everyone is of how important and
1190, 3, for the music of , the scene changed immediately , from grunge to hip . in the case for ii men , they became even more popular then the boys from . at that time ,
4901, 4, when it has came down to michael , he has made some really good songs that have been worth their while . not only that , but unlike so many other artists of today , he
2923, 3, there always has been something that has been said about michael jackson , past and present . musically , he had shown a lot of brilliance . but personally , michael was suffering internally and that
6899, 4, it has been awhile since has came out with a good song . her last album of an was an absolute and her last song was a absolutely song . her last time she had made
7642, 2, when it has came down to lady and her talent , she actually did n't deliver in regards to the music from her record . instead , the songs have been a big of that have
8469, 1, there is honestly a difference between a , and a singer who has really been to where their music is not even worth listening to anymore , because they are severely and . unfortunately , is
8467, 5, there honestly can be so much said about the music of the 80 's . there are some songs that are really beyond the soul of the heart , and others that may make you think
3022, 5, it is so hard to believe that it has been a week since we had lost the legendary , and you cannot how and soulful her voice to many . but with i wanna dance with
8243, 3, it has been a very long time since came out with new music . but nevertheless , he wanted his work in his songs to be his way , and not the way of what the
2839, 5, there is no question that when it has came down to , musically she has no for all . her songs from her days with have been the strike of her career . un my heart
5444, 4, there is no question that today there has been a huge of good songs on the radio . more artists have chosen to do poor samples from distinctive songs , instead of just covering them .
7541, 3, when it has came down to new artists , they have to have the right notes and the right rhythm to make a song deliver . but when it does come down to make up and
9381, 4, when it has came down to , he has been one of the most distinctive that had ever came out in the 70 's . with he showed he was a amazing drummer , and stepped
7372, 4, when it has came to , she has had her own sound , her own class and a real and respect for soul r b music that back t the days of james brown , as
9214, 4, there is honestly a lot that i do love about sam smith . one thing is that he really has had some excellent songs that have sincerely came from the heart and the intimate soul .
2512, 5, there is no doubt that with when anyone has tried to do the star or america the beautiful and it out of the park , it can be amazing . but for doing it back in
1519, 4, it is so sad that whenever someone who has been so and away , and no one really knows him just beyond what one song that everyone really is about . e . king was one
6461, 4, when it has came down to keys , ultimately she has been the best artist that has came out the past decade of music . she has had the and especially the style to match in
1020, 4, hard to believe that it has been a decade since the legendary johnny cash passed away . yet , his music was definitely a of absolute talent and brilliance in song as well . but when
6175, 4, when it has honestly came down to music lately , there have been a lot more artists than good ones , and good songs from great artists . but , there is always something waiting in
9535, 4, this past year so far , we 've have lost a lot of that really did know the strength of making great music with the of david and . but also , we 've seen a
11641, 2, when it has came down to , her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile . it has been a very long while since she came out with new songs
8517, 2, it is honestly and absolutely so sad that when someone young and , really has thrown their own career away . for , she has really made more music that has been mediocre and lacking real
2239, 5, hard to believe it has been two years since the world has lost an iconic legend , . but nevertheless , her voice will always past mostly all of today 's female artists because the most

3612, 4, , when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being
9556, 2, it has really became clear to me that has been one of the worst products that have came out the past decade . not only for her own work , but she sadly has had some
9013, 4, honestly , the past few years for robin have been very hard for him and his personal life , with the end of his to , and losing big in regards to a with his song
4117, 4, when it does come down to john legend , he has been mostly known as the next , because of his ballads like heaven knows and his single ordinary people . but , he has n't
2388, 4, there is no question that michael jackson was a one of a kind . while he was popular , he died with a very broken heart , and with nothing to show for it , with
9589, 2, it is absolutely so sad that has taken a whole lot of chances by bringing yet another surprise record , and the lack of her voice has been nothing more short of a whom has been
6584, 4, when it has came down to music this past year , there have really really been very few artists that have made the mark nicely in voice and heart with their songs , than cheap surprises
8248, 4, there is no doubt that it has been nearly a decade since jason broke through musically with his single , the . yet , he really has had some good songs that really spoke well the
5225, 4, there is so much that can be said about the legacy of john , and his songs from top to bottom . yet , it is so sad that it has been 35 years since john
2782, 4, it is so hard to believe that it has been 15 years since keys came out of the music industry , and has shown that her work , her voice and her style have been both
902, 4, there is no question about really great songs from the 80 's that still stand the test of time , not just because they are , but they still remain more than many of today 's
5088, 3, there has been no doubt that there has been a lack from the talent from american this past year , not just on the show but with those who 've been past and . for ,
3112, 5, hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is
3755, 5, it is honestly so sad whenever someone young and leaves this earth so soon , and yet you really forget about the joy and beauty that person has left behind in their music . that has
3905, 4, there is so much that i can say about female singer of today , they sincerely do not even come from the heart . with artists like , and others have sincerely sounded more like than
5849, 3, it has been a that has n't really brought out her a game into her songs recently . with following up to all i ever wanted , has had a strong gamble to make it worth
4795, 3, when it has came down to these days , it has been more about her personal life , than the of the music she wants to sing . it is very sad that she has not
7373, 2, when it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices . , whom back up for chris brown on his michael jackson hit she ai n't you , has a lot
11552, 4, when it has came down what had shown in music , she has more in her voice than almost all of the artists of today in the music industry . but sadly , she has been
5507, 2, there is no question that has n't been in the best of shapes musically . while people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new for american this year
7637, 2, it is absolutely awful whenever someone has became more of a product than a strong singer . pulling a surprise record to the music industry , well has had a lot of wasted songs that has
2388, 4, hard to believe today it is five years since michael jackson lost his own life the way he did . i definitely do not think michael jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a
4860, 4, there is no doubt about the feeling of the voice within these days . but there are those few that have been one hit wonders that have proven to be a bit more than that .
796, 5, when it has came down to john , musically the 90 's definitely brought out the best in 's voice , after getting his life back together from , and from the media in england ,
7317, 2, when it has came down to , she has n't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted . that appeal is written all in her album .
7485, 2, there is no question that has been so , that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has away . her music has been more like a fashion of time , but
7832, 3, there is no question that today 's music feels much more like it has really been wasted from the heart , and lost its . for acts like jason , he has had a hard time
6259, 3, when it has came down to train , they definitely have made some excellent songs over the past several years , that have continued to shine with train 's musical status , of making the kind
7373, 2, when a new artist comes out with a song , she has to really drive into her first song . for who back on chris brown 's big hit she ai n't you , which worked
7059, 3, when it has came down to , he has had some great songs over the years , on his own and as a part f the brothers . but it has been awhile since mr .
5637, 3, last year has been a big year for . with her with the stars , and being a new addition for the sing off for , she has had a bit of . musically , she
8855, 2, there is so much that can be said for in her personal life right now . the end of her relationship with her future had ended with him on her , and also her music has
7869, 3, when it has came down to what michael jackson in his lifetime , he showed a great deal of good songs , but some of the times , he had songs he had recorded , have
9561, 3, when it has came down to movie songs for , lately they honestly just have not been able to in the way they used to back years ago , and all the way through to the
1165, 3, the past few years have really brought out for pop star grant . she had moved back into her christian well with her core audience , but unfortunate , she has n't been able to click
3112, 5, hard to believe that would have been 50 , but her legacy is just as today , as it was when she first stepped onto the stage . all of her songs still whether it is
11778, 4, it surprises me that there are still some singers that have been more , than really soulful on radio . unfortunately , has been one of those that does deserve more credit because of her soul
4056, 3, when it has came down to pink , she has n't really hit that nail on the head with the songs yet . after her recent breakup from her , that still has n't yet stopped
8894, 3, the past several years have been very rough for . she had a gripe with her label , and said to sony . overall , she took a step further within her voice , and tried
6418, 4, it has nearly been a decade since we 've heard anything from . musically , they have been from the scene for a long time , while did well on his brief on american . but
8416, 3, it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything fresh and striking from . she had been from making music for quite a long time , not just on her own , but
9662, 3, when it has came down to movie songs lately , they have seemed to run out of the magic . unfortunately , i believe that is why everyone lately has been trying to do cover songs
2664, 5, hard to believe that it has been 30 years since made his last hit , form the love record . the song definitely still is a classic today , as it was when it came out
7632, 2, there is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real , human and voice , and someone who themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person . unfortunately , is
7067, 3, when it has came down to , lately has been joy in the of for her and her husband . with a little one on the way , she has a lot to . still ,
5660, 3, it is sad that when an artist has n't really brought out their best in their music . unfortunately for lady , her latest album has shown to be more of a of songs from the
9014, 4, it has been quite awhile since there has been any good songs that have came out from robin . the past few years have been more sad from his personal and professional life . from the
10549, 4, when it has came down to michael jackson , he was arguably one of the most remarkable artists that had ever lived in our modern times . but honestly , it has nearly been seven years
7634, 2, there is honestly so much that can be said about and the severe she has had in her music the past decade . honestly , when it has came down to it , she has been
7894, 4, when it has came down to what ed has tried to show in his music , has been more hip based than what his natural beauty in his heart . he had some really great songs
5281, 4, there is no question that has came a long way . not only from abuse , cancer , and , but returning to forum from his well received gap band days in the 70 's and
3842, 5, when it came down to in the 70 's and 80 's , they definitely some of the most driven and shining songs of the . but when it also came down to , and company
8436, 5, there is no question that so many of today 's are really more like trashy pop , than really showing what the voice is suppose to be from the inside . but honestly , so many
2108, 4, there are just so many hits that seem to miss out when it really comes to very successful artists . that has always been the case with love songs as well , because there are just
5014, 3, there is no question that like so many other r b acts for the past few years , has had the gamble to . after the past few new songs like every time the beat drops
263, 4, hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the death of . musically , she was one of the most soulful r b in the world . yet , in the way was remembered
7129, 3, when it has came down to , she has had her ups and . yet , her music has been in favor of her 's child friend . sadly though , the songs that she has
2239, 5, there is no doubt of hearing of the death of , i was deeply beyond whatever words could ever say . musically , she being the world 's great soulful singer , whom not only made
5691, 4, has had a share of ups and musically the past several years . but when it has came down to her , she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her
5348, 3, when you think of classic musical acts , there are fewer than far between that have shined as brightly like the piano man , . it has nearly been 40 years since he released his album
6246, 2, there is no question that just has n't been able to shimmer in her music lately . she has focused too much on the dance pop music , that she has n't really stretched her voice
7632, 2, when it has came down to right now , her life has been in . her self surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears , and absolutely her heart .
8606, 5, when it has came down to , there have been so many people who 've wrote her off for a very long time because of the faults she went through , from her personal abuse ,
2851, 4, it has been over a decade since santana made history , with , and the win of eight making it the record that won the most in music history . there is no doubt about it
6011, 2, when it has came down to what had shown musically , it honestly has been too and , not even close to enough of her voice . sadly , it has also out her talent she
5018, 3, it is so sad that it has been seven years since the world lost the legendary johnny cash . but while his music stands the test of time over the years , some of the songs
8936, 4, there are just very few songs today that really have tapped from the soul of the heart that really have meant something overall . for someone like day whom has struggled so much in regards to
2542, 4, there is no question that it still feels so that passed away at 48 years old . yet , she left behind a remarkable and beautiful on voice and song . how will i know showed
2404, 4, to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio
test
6686, 2, when it has came down to , she has clearly shown that she has made some very poor choices with her life . not just with her music , but going back to the man who
11580, 2, when it has came down to lady and the songs that she has delivered for her record , they actually have not been as strong and striking as they were when she first did the fame
2930, 2, last year 's american winner , , really has n't hit the nail on the head with great songs on her . while her single was a fair song , it just has n't shown that
9568, 5, when i had just found out about the death of , i was deeply beyond what words can say . but for me , i went back to her voice and singing her songs in of
5888, 4, it has been very hard to see and hear hall , when he has recorded solo music away from his and pleasure work with john . nevertheless , he has had some good songs before like
4805, 4, there are sometimes those songs that actually can be surprising from the mind when you least expect it . that is the case with city , and their single , . when i first heard the
6863, 4, it has been awhile since came out with a very good song . the songs from her 2010 album let were n't actually impressive in the very end . but some of the songs from 's
6376, 5, 2012 has already proven to be a sad year for music . no further is the passing of . she showed more in voice than any of today 's female artists in each note than someone
11473, 4, there is honestly so much that can be said about david . he has made music for 50 years and continues to change as time has gone by , as the chameleon has has been .
6985, 2, , when it has came down to , she has been the most over , shrill artists of the past decade . it has been more of the , and her voice stopped showing . that
4952, 2, honestly , when i heard 's latest album , i really did n't feel any bit of the energy she seemed to have out from good girl gone bad . i was n't very surprised about
5578, 3, there is no question that has had a rough time trying to deliver as a solo act away from the from 's child . while has had the , has had a few rough . after
5518, 4, there is no question that when it has came down to music , has been one of the most distinctive of the year . her smash rolling in the deep brought so many people into her
5592, 2, there is no that when an artist seems to be on fire with their music career , they seem to feel like they can do no wrong . unfortunately for , she has hit a massive
4849, 4, when it has came down to lately , many people have the classic r b rhythms last year with the of 's anniversary . but , with all the , there was also with the death
11224, 4, when it has came down to george michael , whom will his birthday this june , his songs from his own have been excellent from start and finish . not only because they are true blue
4223, 4, when it has came down to , she has honestly been the most product of the past several years . sadly , the quality of her music and has died over quantity . when it has
9553, 4, it has been a very , very long time since we have really heard anything from , musically and personally . he had promised at one point to make a trio of , after his past
9553, 4, it has been a very long time since we 've heard anything from musically and personally . after 2009 's night album , many his soulful voice and heart brilliantly . nevertheless , many have him
1122, 4, hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since sting had started his successful solo career , after he had said to the police . honestly , the songs that sting has done on
2705, 4, when it comes down to it , keys really does know how to some beautiful songs . after the success of no one from as i am , her fourth album , she shows absolutely no
2069, 4, hard to believe that it has been 15 years since the death of michael , and the end of . musically the 80 's have been very strong to them with kick , and their ,
4164, 3, back in the late 90 's , we 've seen a huge explosion in the music industry . while there have been acts that have been more about , and less of heart and soul like
7482, 3, it has been awhile since came out with good music . he showed that a few years ago with not afraid from his album , and he did show that earlier this year with song from
5578, 3, it has been awhile since came out with an album . but lately she has shown that she is trying to be more of a singles act . after the failure of ms . , she
7637, 2, it is absolutely so sad that whenever someone becomes more like a manufactured product , that the voice slowly away and died . unfortunately , is one of those singers who is a manufactured product .
7894, 4, there is so much you can honestly say about ed , and the songs that he has made over the past few years . there are some that could 've been better that really caused him
1138, 5, when it has came down to sting 's songwriting , he has shown a lot for his solo work , but that also worked very well with the of the police , and the way they
1890, 4, it is honestly and absolutely so sad when someone young and their life away from all the in the world they can never get over . unfortunately one of those 90 's , from stone and
2485, 4, the music of the 70 's today has shown a effect on what we hear on radio and on television today . although there are times where we see the past as something better than the
11307, 2, there is no question that from the fame has had some ups and down away from being a cat . one of them was last year as winner of with the stars . but musically ,
5022, 2, there are sometimes newer artists that can be strong , but others that make music that feels like it is mediocre , and that is honestly the case with ha . while she does have might
5874, 3, when it has came down to music today , there are much fewer and farther between artists that have really made some great songs . for , she has n't been able to shine musically ,
5467, 3, when the past few it came down to in music , no one seem to top it off more than the script . they 've had some pretty ones like , and for the first time
774, 5, there is no question that this year marks john 's anniversary since he met and became one of the most songwriting in the world . there have been so many classics that have been so strong
1122, 4, if there is honestly one thing that i do adore about sting , is that has been a master artist at really making great songs on his own . he has been doing it for 30
7486, 2, when it has came down to what has done in music , it has n't actually been the best for both worlds . for her hard core fans , and for those new to her music
11311, 3, it has honestly been a very longtime since ii men has ever made a song with another artist . while so many have thought of one sweet day with 16 years ago . but while the
7996, 2, when it has came down to what has made out of her music , it honestly has n't been as strong as she had shown it when she came out back in the 90 's .
7336, 3, it has been awhile since came out with a strong song . while she had really good rhythm and strength on her 2010 album pulse , many people did n't go to it . so when
4776, 3, when came back onto the music scene with pretty earlier this year , he recorded a song that was just absolutely soulful and sophisticated . for his latest album night , it has just been very
7484, 2, when it has came down to , she has really made some and songs that have n't hit the nail on the head . trying to follow up california has n't really been a big success
7867, 3, sadly , it almost has been five years since michael jackson passed away , and sadly almost all of the songs have n't been as strong as what made the king of pop such a in
9469, 3, when it has came down to fifth harmony , they have been one of those girl groups that might have style , but honestly the girls have not had one thing that them from the rest
5646, 3, when it has came down to the people , they definitely made a great pleasure impression with up kicks which really was one of the biggest surprises of last year . but they really have too
4810, 4, honestly for , she has not received that recognition with stronger success after her from 's child a few years ago . nevertheless , she has finally found her sound with the beat of regret .
7484, 2, when it has came down to , she really has made some terrible songs for the past several years . but trying to follow up the success she has had with songs like roar and california
3426, 4, it is just so sad that there really have n't been any who 've made it in the industry . after the appeal of the from american and poor record sales , it has been very
1588, 4, it is always and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and on , it always hits you at the soul of the heart musically . that happened with michael jackson , and john because of
7873, 3, when it has came down to what michael jackson made into his voice and the way he made dance for so many singers and was one of a kind . yet , his passing five years
8387, 4, there is no question that for , she has had a hard road trying to follow up what had shown in music . her album love war showed a lot of good songs , but some
7394, 4, it has been a very , very long time since came out with new music . she has gone through a lot of changes with her daughter turning from girl to man as becoming a man
4222, 4, when it does come down to , they definitely have known not only how to make great videos , but very songs too that most of the time do n't feel like they are gimmicks .
712, 5, there are sometimes so few songs that are just so that they have never gone out of style . especially when it has came down to love ballads from the 80 's . though has been
5466, 4, when it has came down to real artists , and not , there are very few and far between acts that have made great melodies speak just for themselves , with good music . the script
9038, 3, it surprises me when someone who has a great talent , can make a very fair song . has made so many great songs in her career like golden and a long walk . but the
9597, 4, it has been quite awhile since we have heard anything new from keys . musically , the past several years have not seen her at her best musically with her last album girl on fire .
8290, 4, it is sincerely such a same that female singers of today , have sincerely stopped coming from the heart . they just have n't been able to really deliver in the voice and the heart .
3612, 4, , when it comes down to the so called it girls , most of them are really more about the hype like , , and the that seem to miss out for their songs by being
2404, 4, to really be honest with you , this past year has been very difficult to actually find what has been good in pop music . while so many artists like and have taken so much radio
2445, 5, when it has came down to 's best movie songs , the one that is always turned to is the i will always love you from the . but to follow it up with waiting to
2239, 5, it is hard to believe that today is the first anniversary since 's death . while the music industry has seen dramatic changes , what it has not been able to show is a and depth
6158, 3, it has been over a decade since both have up with their smash hit the boy is mine . yet , it is also a bit rough for both of them each right now , dealing
891, 4, it is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and dies early before their time . with the shocking news of the passing of chris of , it is just another reminder of rock roll excess from
5742, 3, there is no question that five has had a bit of musically with hands all over . although was a good song , the following single , never gonna leave this bed or give a little
10314, 5, there are so many songs that are just so , they are more constant of one artist than most of their catalog at the soul . for whom has made music for over 20 years ,

9077, 3, is still the standard of because who else could make folks wait nearly two decades for said follow up ? now to me the will always be a standard period . and i still feel that

3811, 4, i have always enjoyed the fifth dimension . the re mastering sounds really good there voices sound strong . i heard alot of there cuts when i was a kid always remembered them .
9630, 3, de la soul a different era of hip and they were able to blend a of feel and yet be direct within a context and yet offer their own all at once . this album feels
6509, 2, i 've heard there stuff and its a cool of the sounding stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things , however they fall into a phrase called time music which works

3376, 5, to many duets on each others today . but once in a while you get a dream duet and this one is classic . hearing two showing off there chops is a must have . a
998, 2, johnny is one of the best vocalists i 've heard over the past 20 plus years but alot of the time the words music do n't match his overall presentation . i dig the cut with
6403, 4, always been a huge fan of the and michael jackson will always be the king of music to me and he left a mark unlike so few before or since . anyway lets get to the
8474, 3, its a cool album where some of the tracks he got some real and then its hit and miss . dig his flow and vibe and it works . in places and a cool set .
3290, 4, i the better than the film . the music sounds good through out . if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible . the is solid here .
1720, 5, great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it .

3846, 5, you feel her soul and power on these . this is the real . hearing her doing gospel music is to the soul ears . a must have .

6379, 2, broke r . still doing a broke take and no musical . now the cat can sing and has moments where his voice saves otherwise paint by the numbers material which leaves alot to be desired
7294, 2, kid rock is a frustrating act because just solely on the music front , he covers a few styles , problem is on an album like this he forgot the songs and settles for of what
3285, 4, i really like james taylor live . his material takes on another meaning for my ears . i truly enjoy his versions of his biggest hits live . your face you 've got a friend ,
8978, 2, straight up this cat has always had a nice voice and i his longevity from the to film , tv , etc . . cat has kept a brand going , however musically he has always
4481, 5, is a very artist to me . her voice is still something else it 's hard to believe she has been around as long as she has is only in her 40 's . she is
7818, 2, i guess if you use the formula and solo then throw a bone to and and have a 90 's vibe going on then it will make you appear as something more than the surface .
1694, 5, one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he
9440, 3, for as as she is and the fact she has a good sound and appeal her solo material tends to leave me rather cold . and while no doubt had good cuts and i feel they
1208, 4, george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that
8312, 3, its a standard album and at this point and time in her career she has stayed on course with a and its worked with where she is going and wanting to do . now her approach
3273, 5, paul was more than one song . he can sing with feeling . this set his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very .

999, 3, hearing this album right after hearing 's i think they should tour together . on a mellow tour asap . little things takes it 's groove from 's with a wonder vibe from her vocal presentation
4993, 5, one of those songs which is and easy and it feels good to the ears and it still moves the feet . the harmony and the groove is on point . very soulful and a strong
4570, 2, is arguably one of the most over hyped acts over the past decade easily . when she first arrived in her post pop era she seemed like something different . you know was a but in
7343, 5, the beach boys say summer with their music and also a time period and time . this collection takes you back to a different time and a this music is truly feel good and laid back
1157, 4, this cut still goes hard and i loved the harmony and vibe of this jam . very nine 's and yet direct and its a cool song to have a crisp fall day .
9162, 2, one of those artists that had the goods , however he never got the goods . like that pro who was top tier talent , however said person either never had the right , system or
6434, 4, rare earth were a good group . i just want to is a tight jam . their take on the get ready is cool . interestingly is their take on the j five 's hum along
6665, 1, on the for real , for real it seems like musically got musically after the late 80 's and lost what once made him a force back in the day . this song is boring and
8167, 2, is one of those where i keep expecting her to go full james and expect a classic song or , etc . instead of getting her doing 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from lightweight
8247, 2, is one of the best technical sounding and he always kept a groove and of course i the old triangle base he came out of with . problem is he is a third tier version of
9153, 1, somewhere between being a broke meets a broke and a couple of other acts in places . eye candy factor she is on point , as a music artist she is almost below zero . her
1720, 5, great song and it has so much going on the details and the . it makes you think and feel its depth and the music has a rich quality about it .
3416, 2, oh the album 's how they have changed the game ? did this concept for many a moon but it was santana that has gotten all the juice from it in big term sales . so
6302, 3, john is a musician and overall artist , however this album feels like he went about making an album that takes away from his best strengths as a artist and feels like he settled for a
1813, 4, i first got hip to of watching on with , ernie during the show when i heard this brother on the steel guitar like he was i was like i gotta get that set as soon
1923, 2, is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation
7197, 3, is still as sharp as all get up , however doing a duet with a broke in the album way down and the same goes when is singing with a broke r . in . needs
7492, 5, jackson get right all thru here . the words music have genius all over them . i have never heard a bad recording with these two great on it . very straight up at you .
538, 3, he has some trip out jams just like the you gonna trip out on it from start to finish . i have had some of his hits for a few years if you can get into
8546, 4, really good balance of the past and present on this album . i 'm glad to see in his solo career and what an act two his solo career has been ? good combination and how
1694, 5, one of the all around musical ever was jr . i mean he truly a stage and knew the licks and timing and really put something on a tune . i 've gotta be me he
9554, 4, paul always keeps his own vibe and groove going and he is truly one of the best ever and the man stays in his and makes music stay steady with his presentation . this album finds
7148, 5, stone is one of the greatest musical ever and the bridges and path his sound and style set are still many decades and later and always will to me . and the family stone are one
4934, 4, is clearly one of the artists going today . as a songwriter , singer and musician not to mention as a live act he got his thing together . he came back with an album which
4307, 1, i like the concept but sounds just like anyone else be it or . alot of the material you can feel in the blank of where you heard it before . she still has time to
1098, 5, yes i agree this is of material that 's been put out so many times . but for the new this is a great introduction . in the , jimmy , nowhere to run . so
2657, 5, george michael wrote this song as a and it had held up so many . one of the slow jams and the lyrics and vocals still are fresh .
6788, 3, i have always and lady t . . no to , , etc . . however we did n't to leave these to have true blue eyed soul that stayed true to the root . never
2111, 5, this is one of george 's greatest . his playing vocals are incredible . this still shine . a must have .
5255, 4, first and foremost i always when black artists take back country music because country music is the baby of r b and gospel music . ray , and have showed you it can be done and
19, 1, is to me . this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day . makes me think of 's closer meets 's white . is trying to channel so much , but
1208, 4, george sounds real good on the duet with jackson on music row . country music like other styles of music have been increasingly down over the past decade for more but does n't fall into that
8178, 2, it was hit and miss in places . the best duet was with wonder and it worked . the rest are met with mixed results at best . good and production . the duet with john
1383, 3, the thing with j . is that she is bound to have a few cuts on her that i can get with such as just fine . that song is cool and compliments her . she
8684, 2, they missed the boat by not having the better songs on the disc . the better cuts are all on the mp3 having said that the songs work better for the show as to their own
1923, 2, is a cat with a top tier strong voice , problem is the content and the fact he does n't have anybody to push his vocal . he to be the , johnny of his generation
9089, 4, to me the hardest part of the entertainment industry is and having and making it all connect on the stage and with the pace of the music and this does that and more , its a
4015, 2, i have heard this album and i do n't get all the hype . is creative to a extent , but she sounds like trying to channel hill and it has a mixed reaction . the
3942, 1, i respect 's skills and the fact he is and , but musically when it comes to what he puts out on himself , there is alot to desired . the tracks feel like they are
5443, 5, nobody and i mean nobody is touching this soul brother when he can go from style to style and not miss a beat . i mean to radio message which echos part 's your love is
2317, 5, the brothers always seem to get right on the smooth jams . you know they are funky as all heck but they have made some of the most important ballads ever . this incredible family act
5198, 2, while knows what his sign is the month he was in , musically he is truly suffering from loss . somewhere between the early 80 's till early 90 's is where is in . while
3, 5, michael jackson has always been period . from his days as a kid leading the to his incredible adult solo run . his vocal instrument alone has touched so many lives . his instrument of a

5476, 4, this is excellent electronic background music . many nicely assembled songs . music should help you zone into what ever you 're working on while listening .
6915, 3, this is a mellow rock song with interesting vocals . the best way to understand is to listen . it is pretty good .

10899, 1, i love the title . however that is about it . it is just generic thrash metal over vocals that sound like a in a .
6997, 3, it would make good background music for a laid back party . however , it did n't strike me as outstanding . it was n't bad though .
7138, 3, the vocalist seems to have talent . not a fan of the music otherwise . if you think contemporary is awesome , then this is your song .
6996, 3, it has a retro pop feel of which i am not a fan . the 80 's can stay in the past . however , this might be perfect for breaking out the and james and

1653, 5, this song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song .
7245, 4, i have some of there songs other then this and i like all of them , they have a fun beat and a cool back beat .
11519, 4, i was expecting a modern sound from the picture , but is coffee house jazz , with a sound so be warned . you might like it , i do , but it is jazz .
5493, 4, if you have ever listened to a song and tried to decide , do i like this or not ? this is one of those , i would not say that i do n't like it
4684, 4, i usually go for faster music but this mp3 album has a nice kind of mix and flavor you will enjoy .
6070, 2, i look for a little more umph in my music then this album has , if you like slow you will like this .
6374, 3, this song remind me of a lot of off the beaten path songs , wants to be one of a kind , and is . a mix of pop and coffee house music .
6843, 4, bravo , , this song does not fail to please , nice voice and feeling to every word . well done , a must have .
6424, 5, a good slow mood song , the sound of her voice is sweet and and even with the slow pace it makes you want to along . she has talent .
6942, 3, it reminds me of a slower heavy metal song by a hair band , and quickly becomes acid metal . then switches back .
7345, 3, the song is and easy to listen to but the words make you if there is a kid in the room , or a person . too bad , they could have had a hit with
4828, 3, the music is well picked but some of it sounds a little slow when put with other songs . it is a nice mix non the less and i am enjoying it very much .
11463, 2, i am not sure what the artist was doing here but wow . a little too odd for me . i am not sure what to say except that i did not like it .
6513, 4, this song has a very reggae pop feel to it , it has a fun sound and an interesting feel to it . reminds me of an 's song in some ways , very .
11467, 4, a good workout song , reminds me of a lot of workout songs with no words , keeps the beat fast and going .
6720, 5, this is such a fun song , you find yourself in your seat and wanting to jump up and dance around . and you will .
11530, 2, a lot of the same words and the music goes in circles , they could have done more with it to make it a lot better , i am not sure what , but having less
6821, 5, this song has a good feel to it even if the lead singer sounds a little , i could see this song going main the second some one finds it .
5787, 3, i was expecting to have at least a couple of fast songs , while some of it is much like bob 's slower works , it is a slow jam mp3 for sure .
6621, 5, good work out song and neat song on every level . i would recommend it to any one looking for a fun song .
7304, 4, it has a nice quality to it , but it is a little slow and drawn out , but it has a nice sound and is well put together to keep you listening without too much
1653, 5, this song rocks on a dance level and any one who likes a great beat and a good time party song will love this song .
11268, 4, i have listened to this a couple of times , it 's not too slow but not really fast either . could grow on a person , depends on what you are looking for . i
6867, 4, a fun song with a beat that is easy to listen to at any time and easy to add to a play list
6262, 4, it has a good message and melody , a little for any one not looking for that , but a fun song .
7002, 3, all i can say is what ? she has a great voice what was up with the music sounding like it is in the background , it takes a good song and makes it annoying .
6301, 1, i was not into it , you might be , but i was not . not in my library any more . i like some thing a little different then this .
11476, 4, it remind me of pop , meets , rock , meets new age , meets all in it 's own . a nice song for the buck
11532, 2, sounds like the background music for a horror film or a james film . i found it wanting on many levels . too bad , they could have so much more with it .
test
6860, 5, if you like true celtic ballads and music that is green to the core you will love this album . great
6848, 3, a quiet day song that makes an easy listening song happy . a sweet idea to add to any music library .
6833, 3, reminds me of a mode song or something odd but interesting . a little too drawn out at points but a kind of cool song to add to the mix .
11558, 3, has the f word and a little disturbing lyrics at one point but it 's a good song for the most part . just disturbing , leaves you wondering what he 's trying to say .
11483, 4, this song had a quick pace and good tempo with an interesting personality . reminds me a little of a with soul .
7283, 4, a blue sound with great lyrics and a good beat , it is easy to listen to any where . i recommend it
6994, 1, i was not , it was hard to listen to and a major , there way a darkness to it that deeply me . no positive side to it . and the added nothing to it
11571, 3, the sound is slow and , and has much left to be desired with a beat , lyrics and leaves you wanting , well more out of a song .
6819, 3, i was expecting a more pop or dance sound to it , it 's more country , slow country with a lot of bass . not a bad song , but not what you expect from

10325, 5, this song is and as hell . i do n't really get sick of listening to it and was one of my favorites back then . still is . although her later music does n't compare
3497, 5, is the you get to see when listening to this cd . it was a before but now ... well . let 's just start here when i first listened to this cd , i was
1314, 5, this track is quite alright with me . the music is great , piano driven pop with hand to boot . the lyrics are definitely deep enough to get you thinking if you actually know what
3748, 3, yes , the topic is nothing deep and sometimes you just wanna hate it but the scheme and the fun lyrics drive this song into listen able territory . it 's that this will get your
5443, 4, r . 's late 2010 release is quite spectacular . the vibe , the lyrics and the lack of his prove to be the ever more sexy . the track music must be a lady (
1485, 3, this song is funny . it 's decent but many hate it , and i guess i ca n't blame them . i however , liked it enough to write a review on it so you
3499, 3, at least makes it interesting though . ray j 's part is , and very but it 's easy for someone to get tired of it before the end of the song . on the video
3111, 4, even when they 're up against the wall . i must admit that i this because i was tired of brit . i was sick of seeing her everywhere and the life that she has led
5619, 5, is no to good songs . this song which was a single back in 2011 is pretty good . its a feel good tune with two singers who can sing their faces off ! the melody
2930, 4, and i do n't think she 's writing any of her material but that 's ok for now . she just started out . but my point with the title was that was safe . so
4647, 2, and no whatsoever . but is that a surprise ? nope . there really is n't much to the song whatsoever . but i was nice with the rating because it 's not the worst song
4769, 4, i love watching people dance to this cut . it 's fun ! anyway , we all know this song by now . is talking about and how he wants to handle a woman in the
1046, 4, december , 2009 ( one 04 am ) a beautiful mid tempo from miss . . this is definitely in my top two favorite songs by her . in fact , if you were to ask
2812, 5, this album is simply amazing . it 's , it 's but there are soft spots too where she does n't . if you like pop rock and have n't heard this yet , i strongly
5996, 3, j . 's 2nd single is definitely a black woman 's power for the guys that keep them excited and guessing , but do n't necessarily treat them the best . i generally like most of

4170, 3, september , 2009 at first i 'm not sure i liked this song that much . even when i got the album it was n't something i played over and over . in fact , i
3612, 4, the way it 's is what grabs me . i do n't really know all the lyrics but i think just the way it sounds is enough to grab me in . nice vocals , especially
7357, 5, ok . for once can we just judge the music on its own ? if you like dance pop electronic dance music with lyrics you will probably like this song a lot . i think the
668, 4, it 's so slow and just makes you wanna go play on the beach or something . then the wherever , wherever , wherever you go 's come in and you melt . has a way
6523, 2, i must say that i only liked a couple of the songs ( and that 's almost pushing it ! ) . tears of joy , soon as i get home ( live in la )
2480, 4, , 2009 and i say positively because this one is more compared to a lot of his , although not an . face talks about being at work and wanting to come home to the girl
1156, 4, this song features nice lyrics that give you just a taste of what to expect on the cd . very and sing a long ish . but the best part of this song ( if you
5057, 3, april 1st , 2010 ( two 09 am ) one . still standing a pretty hot beat but starts out slow and quiet . the lyrics are good . 's is ok , but not completely
7332, 3, last night ( ) is the best song here . it has a melody that 's easy to and the song itself is kinda pleasant . the rest of the songs range from come ons to
4807, 3, but kind of fun all in the same . it 's just kinda . but the beat is cool . i just wish it had more umph . i do n't have the disc ; a
2376, 5, is that it was about someone who died from an . i know that when i first heard this song it came and went . i did n't pay much attention to it at all .
1866, 5, , fun and tune . two thumbs up high .
5557, 2, please do n't give me that she 's only 13 excuse . it 's lame . even some of 's songs are miles ahead of this . and when she was 13 blows this girl way
3745, 2, it 's fun , it 's the chorus is but ultimately , the song itself is kinda . 's a pretty girl and i her for writing or co writing all of her tracks on ;
1572, 4, december 2nd , 2009 ( two 48 am ) if you are behind the times like i was , get into this track . it is extremely and even more is the bridge which goes ,
3102, 3, this song is nice . a pleasant radio friendly mid tempo . nice vocals . it 's without it . lyrics do n't discover new ground but it 's still inspiring . while it 's not
1627, 5, this song is amazing . and they say that a hero can save us . i 'm not gonna stand here and wait . i 'll hold on to the ways of the . and watch
6348, 4, first off i have to say 's voice is quite amazing in a soft , way . in a way he reminds me of who made his with his single all i want is you j
1053, 4, it 's a slow groove in which and a bit towards the end . love by and is an instant r b classic . it love and provides you with a great musical experience . prepare
3003, 2, how annoying is this song ? he says shake about and it gets so damn . two stars .
1388, 4, the and the are very fun and it makes me wanna dance . to be honest though , when this song came out i was n't impressed at all . it was not until that i
2480, 4, , 2009 and i say positively because this one is more compared to a lot of his , although not an . face talks about being at work and wanting to come home to the girl
3081, 2, and i say that so loosely . this song was n't great the first time i heard it and it 's still coated . i mean i can get into certain songs that are all pop
3768, 3, even though it 's kinda all over . but when she says , and the seven things i hate the most that you do , you make me love you . you get sucked in .
10552, 5, i miss the old ! classic . not that her latest album was bad , cause it was n't . was actually a decent album . but does n't make music like she used to .
3497, 4, follow through four . 25 stars . i love this song . it 's so . four . five stars . we 've all heard this one a million times . i think it 's a
3081, 2, and i say that so loosely . this song was n't great the first time i heard it and it 's still coated . i mean i can get into certain songs that are all pop
4169, 4, has to be one of the most played songs on the radio these days but this time it 's for good reason it 's , it has good lyrics and it draws one in . has
1866, 5, , fun and tune . two thumbs up high .
1567, 5, i do n't know anyone personally that was crazy about it like me ... but that 's a whole different story ! this song rocks ... cause when you 're out there , without care ,
11793, 5, this song is the ish . beat is absolute fire ! i love third album and this is one of my top picks from it ! made such a good single . wish i heard it
6584, 4, i am going on my 5th listen of this track and must say that is a class act . i 've always actually liked him ( since 's on you ) but man is he consistent
5821, 4, , 2010 really surprised me with this song . not only is it a good song but she sings it well and it fits her vocals really well . she does n't strain , but she
2826, 5, when you are in love , you can feel this song five fold . if you 're not in love , but a like me , then you are n't left out . picked a good
4093, 4, just dance features a mean dance beat and is than hell . yes , i 'm late in saying this , and yes , i 'm still not really a fan of her yet ( weird
3625, 4, touch my body goes places that you 'd expect throw me on the floor play with me some more and to the unexpected if there 's a camera up in here i best not catch this
291, 4, i call him mr . singles because a few of his that i have are mainly good for that the singles . fly away is a good example off of the album , five . it
2376, 5, is that it was about someone who died from an . i know that when i first heard this song it came and went . i did n't pay much attention to it at all .
9080, 3, i do n't know this girl . i know her name , and that she sings the song in question , blah , blah , blah and your love is my . ( not to be
10512, 5, i miss this kind of music from train ; the completely opposite of pop songs that they now have to . ( i do understand why they went that route ( sales of their were )
8223, 3, this cd was kinda disappointing . the vocals are overall alright . and i appreciated the whistle register note in like but this album is kinda boring . theres only like five songs on the album
3426, 4, nice lyrics , pretty girl and a nice vocal range shown . b four stars .
4403, 5, i love this song . im shocked that vocals sound so good on this track . its so . such a beautiful song though . i just it on this morning . a too . id
1485, 3, this song is funny . it 's decent but many hate it , and i guess i ca n't blame them . i however , liked it enough to write a review on it so you
4160, 4, this song is very . it has a fun vibe to it , and you will either be snapping your fingers or tapping your foot or . if not , then you do n't necessarily see
2404, 5, much more things going on , production wise than the version that i have downloaded to my computer . it 's great though , gives it more personality . the version i hear when i listen
5272, 5, this cd is . i love the songs . i think the melodies are killer and . he is part of such a good songwriting team ( the ) . his voice is very pleasant and
1572, 4, december 2nd , 2009 ( two 48 am ) if you are behind the times like i was , get into this track . it is extremely and even more is the bridge which goes ,
5183, 4, 's second single teenage dream is a blast . the lyrics paint a picture of someone who is slightly until they meet someone that makes them feel comfortable enough to let go and be themselves .
1163, 4, i love the fact that decided to stay with fair for some of the tracks on the album . he provides lush string sounds . but anyway , this is a sweet mid tempo well ,
6539, 5, i swear i do n't know what my ears were hearing when i listened to it the first couple of times . but this song is so fun ! dance pop is n't even in my
3003, 2, how annoying is this song ? he says shake about and it gets so damn . two stars .
5407, 5, november , 2010 one . you down ( going in circles ) an like song that features a bit of . we 've all heard said song this summer fall . a two . ten seconds
11099, 4, it 's been about three good , long , years since came with their that the public either like cake or for being generic sounding . either way , it was probably the talk of the
3549, 2, i swear , the beat is pt . two , with the extra , hey 's thrown in there . we just ca n't be original anymore . it 's like we 'd rather bite someone
1388, 4, the and the are very fun and it makes me wanna dance . to be honest though , when this song came out i was n't impressed at all . it was not until that i
1627, 5, this song is amazing . and they say that a hero can save us . i 'm not gonna stand here and wait . i 'll hold on to the ways of the . and watch
7541, 4, this song is cute . i like the beat and the vocals . the production is so . it 's a cool song to just to . glad i downloaded it ! four stars .
4015, 4, one two to the high and is one of the worst tracks here . however , love the line i just need a friend ! seven . five 10 you know i 'm no good one
4948, 4, ... but at least she came with a strong song this time around . i love this song . the beat is the best part of why do n't you love me ? . the lyrics
3984, 4, let me start out by saying i was n't really feeling this song when it first came out . it was ok to me , nothing more nothing less . i did like her voice but
6217, 5, gradually went from an artist i thought would just come and go to being near and to my heart . what got me hooked was actually her first album ( when i gave in and gave
4645, 2, love , , magic ( feat . ) track two on the album and the second single . not the worst song but definitely not really feeling the beat . sure , you guys have heard
5765, 5, i love their voices together in this song . but my absolute favorite part of the whole song is lo 's . i would love to get this album for christmas but i wo n't since
2477, 5, this is my favorite x mas song by and definitely my favorite version of the song ever . the vocals are , the tune , bright and the choir hits all the right notes . when
6532, 5, is finally back after her interesting ; a data hook product link linked class a link normal basic dp ref cm cr d ? ie utf8 basic a ; that did n't do too well on
3549, 2, i swear , the beat is pt . two , with the extra , hey 's thrown in there . we just ca n't be original anymore . it 's like we 'd rather bite someone
6302, 5, 's ; a data hook product link linked class a link normal heavier things dp ref cm cr d ? ie utf8 heavier things a ; is john 's peak to me . he 's a
3749, 3, came out with a solid song for the to eat up . the lyrics are n't too and pull you in if you are a female . not to say that ca n't dig in too
2602, 4, this song is and fun to sing some of the parts ( i still do n't know the whole thing yet ) . the lyrics are n't deep at all but for an song , it
7339, 4, this cd has some filler tracks but overall its decent pop . the bonus tracks are all on the deluxe edition in my book ! is my favorite bonus track . john co wrote it with
1383, 4, before i said this cd was about average . it 's not . it 's just different . there is a bit of hip hip mixed with r b here but once you get past the
4738, 2, it makes no sense and it really is just no good . i respect the black eyed for making songs that you can sing a long to sometimes but this one is just mechanical trash .
888, 4, i 'm a pretty huge fan . her early music ( first three or four ) still hold a special place in my heart . i like her voice and think she 's a . this
2705, 5, ... did i mention there wo n't be a song to touch this , this year ? there seriously is n't gonna be a better song . i do n't need no nor a like miss
1567, 5, i do n't know anyone personally that was crazy about it like me ... but that 's a whole different story ! this song rocks ... cause when you 're out there , without care ,
5088, 4, i love the piano and everything about this song . it feels like music for grown folks to me . and that 's who is gonna like it mostly . a great r b song with
3817, 4, features great vocals and a nice and rhythm . yes , the song works on speak and but here it really , really works for a pop tune . good going , . four . five
1163, 4, i love the fact that decided to stay with fair for some of the tracks on the album . he provides lush string sounds . but anyway , this is a sweet mid tempo well ,
7919, 5, i love this song it 's my jam ! it 's so and awesome . i love the beat and vocals . i wish they played it on the radio like they did holding you down
3497, 5, is the you get to see when listening to this cd . it was a before but now ... well . let 's just start here when i first listened to this cd , i was
999, 4, three . five 5 little things five . 25 five talk to her four . 25 five slow down six five the truth four . 25 five beautiful surprise five 5 three . five 5 get
3426, 4, nice lyrics , pretty girl and a nice vocal range shown . b four stars .
9153, 5, the songs on this album are complete fire ! i love how most of the songs are ! has made one of the best of her time with confident . once i got the whole album
3746, 4, , 2010 ( 12 55 am ) let me start off by saying that this song is awesome . the lyrics are n't superb but they do the job . and to 's credit she wrote
4118, 2, i 'm ok with someone changing their sound a bit just to liven things up . however , there is about 80 less piano here and about 80 of the tunes are so lifeless here .
594, 4, this is a nice , slow type song and the way sings it makes it passable and i respect her for it . the lyrics and vibe of the song make it what it is .
4212, 3, 5th , 2010 ( one 16 am ) yes , some of brit 's new music is trashy ( looks at three ) or trash ( also looks at three ) but this one is .
3770, 1, and the video is just as bad . i mean looks ok , but what 's up with that ? i was expecting a great song since its rated so high up on itunes and what
4093, 4, just dance features a mean dance beat and is than hell . yes , i 'm late in saying this , and yes , i 'm still not really a fan of her yet ( weird
9484, 4, the beats are overall better on this album . there were some tracks on her first album ... not all of them or anything but there was some filler . overall , this album is much
5378, 4, i also do n't usually pay too much attention to 's music because most of it is super stuff . heck , i have n't even listened to one of his yet ( and do n't
895, 5, i know just about all the words to this song and i love it . it comes off of the fabulous album , ; a data hook product link linked class a link normal the sessions
9937, 5, haha . it 's so funny . i love the vibe of the song , and i get some of the lyrics but it 's been a long time since i 've actually looked in the
2930, 4, and i do n't think she 's writing any of her material but that 's ok for now . she just started out . but my point with the title was that was safe . so
6177, 4, i 'm not saying this is a classic or anything because it probably wo n't go down as one . but as far as , foot pop songs go , this one is one of the
4015, 4, one two to the high and is one of the worst tracks here . however , love the line i just need a friend ! seven . five 10 you know i 'm no good one
4307, 4, i bought this cd pretty much on a whim after i had heard her single , everything . let me say that i did n't like her much at all when her first single take me
6578, 3, i 'll make this quick and . not a fan of this lady and probably never will be unless she strips the dance and more serious songs . heard just a of this song on a
2705, 5, ... did i mention there wo n't be a song to touch this , this year ? there seriously is n't gonna be a better song . i do n't need no nor a like miss
4225, 3, this album is okay . review wo n't be long because i do n't care for this album that much . i love and her vocals but other than a small handful of songs this album
400, 5, i 've had this cd for about four years now and i must say that i was n't thoroughly impressed until today ( may 18 , 2011 ) . a bunch of the songs did stand
4092, 3, september 22nd , 2009 ... anyway , onto the song . it 's not that bad really . it 's better than face but not as as . but then again , it 's not as
4981, 3, i love 's . it was fun and fresh . it also had beautiful , ballads . it was a good mix of songs . this cd is a little on the terrible side . boring
1314, 5, this track is quite alright with me . the music is great , piano driven pop with hand to boot . the lyrics are definitely deep enough to get you thinking if you actually know what
836, 4, maybe the beat is tired to some ( it 's from a biggie beat , which was from the original song by an artist i do n't know ) . but i actually have some memories
10793, 3, it was ok at first , but now it 's better . i saw the video and was in or something and i was like , wow . i did n't think she 'd do that
3815, 2, i am a fan of although this song is highly played out now . i mean i think it 's in the top 10 most played out top 40 hits of the past 20 years seriously
6585, 4, i am going on my 5th listen of this track and must say that is a class act . i 've always actually liked him ( since 's on you ) but man is he consistent
10438, 5, when this first played , i was coming home from getting my from work in another town . my mother ( driver ) , me and my were to what was on the radio and then
4322, 5, from this review on ( if i remember ) , i will yet again change the way i rate songs , books , , video , video game systems and everything else . i will rate
5237, 4, 3rd , 2010 ( two 45 am ) unlike her second single , perfect nightmare , the vocals in this song are actually exciting . the lyrics are able and the rhythm , . i 'm
10999, 5, my favorite part is the where she does all of the little runs . it 's so pretty and vulnerable . for such a long time , was my ... back when this cd was new
5389, 5, december , 2010 scale ( deluxe edition ) one life i like the extended version of this already great song which comes on the album . an exceptional song . cheers to life ! b two
10060, 4, love this song . jack johnson has a good song under his belt right here !
6962, 2, i 'm a huge fan of this guy . his vocals are smooth , soulful and damn sexy . he 's also made some great songs ( singles and otherwise ) . most of his material
291, 4, i call him mr . singles because a few of his that i have are mainly good for that the singles . fly away is a good example off of the album , five . it
2826, 5, when you are in love , you can feel this song five fold . if you 're not in love , but a like me , then you are n't left out . picked a good
6158, 4, this is a decent song . it 's r b meets 2012 . nothing earth but acceptable all the same . now compared to the one hit the boy is mine , it is n't quite
3111, 4, even when they 're up against the wall . i must admit that i this because i was tired of brit . i was sick of seeing her everywhere and the life that she has led
4952, 3, it 's . it 's fun . but it 's not really about anything or deep . it 's just a dance song . but when the video comes on , you are . is in
2477, 5, this is my favorite x mas song by and definitely my favorite version of the song ever . the vocals are , the tune , bright and the choir hits all the right notes . when
3767, 4, 's voice is n't the best and on the chorus he sounds kinda bored , but comes in and new life into the song . her voice is as pleasant as it has always been ,
3051, 5, , little when you talk to me i swear the whole world stops you 're my and i 'm so glad you 're mine you are one of a kind and you mean to me what
5873, 5, i love this song because it 's and it 's more or less the song that got me onto and interested in her music . i really like the piano led bridge and the vocals in
test
1046, 4, december , 2009 ( one 04 am ) a beautiful mid tempo from miss . . this is definitely in my top two favorite songs by her . in fact , if you were to ask
472, 4, and very country . i 'm a fan of simple songs but there is not a country song by a male singer that i recall liking . i guess this is the first . i 'm
3625, 4, touch my body goes places that you 'd expect throw me on the floor play with me some more and to the unexpected if there 's a camera up in here i best not catch this
6285, 4, if you could tell , i was n't exactly this song at first . it took me quite a while of hearing it before i warmed up to it ( which happened today ) and now
3757, 4, the is awesome in the beginning . chris martin 's voice is used in a way and the vibe to this song is total ! four . 25 stars .
2404, 5, much more things going on , production wise than the version that i have downloaded to my computer . it 's great though , gives it more personality . the version i hear when i listen
4795, 4, thought at first that she wanted to come back with a but she really felt the energy and the heart of this song and thought it was nothing like she 's ever released . so she
5133, 5, 1st , 2010 ( 12 42 am ) by far . but i 've only heard a few of the songs and they were all just good . not afraid is decent as is love the
3499, 3, at least makes it interesting though . ray j 's part is , and very but it 's easy for someone to get tired of it before the end of the song . on the video
5393, 3, i like first cd , pink friday but this song is a mixed bag . i never really loved it . i like the bridge enough and some parts of the song are alright but i
11060, 4, i know i 'm late but this pop rock song is a keeper . it starts off kinda basic but once the chorus comes in the guitars go crazy ( in such a good way )
4873, 3, one , 2010 ( first review of the new year ! 2010 , hoo ! ) but at the same time , even with the cool snaps and the extremely powerful high note at the end
3981, 4, the , the chorus , the that just build and the singer 's voice all great . i 'm not saying this song is or anything but for a modern alternative rock song , of got
3612, 4, the way it 's is what grabs me . i do n't really know all the lyrics but i think just the way it sounds is enough to grab me in . nice vocals , especially
2812, 5, this album is simply amazing . it 's , it 's but there are soft spots too where she does n't . if you like pop rock and have n't heard this yet , i strongly
9440, 4, pretty good cd as i said . most of the beginning tracks are fire with nice beats . the album is slightly weak because of the bonus tracks on the deluxe edition . but if you
